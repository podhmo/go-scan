# Continuation of Sym-Go Type Switch Implementation

## Initial Prompt

(Translated from Japanese)
"Please read one task from TODO.md and implement it. If necessary, break it down into sub-tasks. After breaking it down, you can write it in TODO.md. Then, please proceed with the work. Keep modifying the code until the tests pass. After finishing the work, please be sure to update TODO.md at the end. The task to choose should be a symgo task. The origin is docs/plan-symgo-type-switch.md, and you can see the overall progress here. The implementation itself is a continuation of docs/cont-symgo-type-switch-3.md. Please do your best to modify the code so that the test code passes. Once it is somewhat complete, please also pay attention to the behavior inside and outside the policy. Please especially address the parts that are in progress. If you cannot complete it, please add it to TODO.md."

## Goal

The primary objective is to fix the remaining test failures related to the `symgo-type-switch` feature, with an immediate focus on making `TestInterfaceBinding` pass. This requires correctly implementing the logic for `interp.BindInterface` within the `symgo` evaluator, ensuring that calls to bound interface methods are correctly dispatched to their concrete implementations.

## Initial Implementation Attempt

My first attempt to fix `TestInterfaceBinding` involved adding logic directly into `applyFunctionImpl` to handle the dispatch from an interface method to a concrete one. While this seemed straightforward, it failed because it bypassed the standard function call machinery, which is responsible for checking for and executing registered intrinsics. The test specifically failed because it expected an intrinsic for `(*bytes.Buffer).Write` to be called, but my implementation called the method's body directly, skipping the intrinsic check.

## Roadblocks & Key Discoveries

My work was characterized by a key insight followed by a significant implementation roadblock.

*   **Key Discovery**: I realized that to solve the `TestInterfaceBinding` failure, `applyFunctionImpl` couldn't just execute the concrete method's body. It needed to re-initiate the entire function application process for the *concrete* method. This means recursively calling the wrapper function `applyFunction`, not `applyFunctionImpl`. This is the only way to ensure the full evaluation pipeline, including intrinsic checks, is triggered for the dispatched call.

*   **Roadblock (Cascading Build Errors)**: The key discovery necessitated a major refactoring: passing an `*object.Environment` through the entire `applyFunction` call stack. This change, while correct, caused a massive cascade of build failures across more than a dozen test files. The core error was simple (swapped arguments in test calls), but the sheer number of failures combined with my own repeated mistakes in applying fixes (e.g., using stale file contents for `replace_with_git_merge_diff`, trying to fix too many files at once) created a frustrating loop that consumed all the available time. I was unable to break out of this loop and get the code back to a buildable state.

## Major Refactoring Effort

Based on the key discovery, I undertook a significant refactoring of `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go`:

1.  I changed the signatures of `applyFunction`, `applyFunctionImpl`, `Apply`, and `ApplyFunction` to accept an additional `*object.Environment` parameter.
2.  I implemented the new interface dispatch logic inside `applyFunctionImpl`. This new logic correctly finds the concrete method and re-dispatches the call by invoking `e.applyFunction(...)` with the new concrete function object.
3.  I began the process of updating all call sites across the codebase to pass the new `env` parameter. This process is incomplete and is the source of the current build failures.

## Current Status

The codebase is currently in a **non-building state**.

*   The core logic in `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go` has been updated with the correct approach for interface binding dispatch.
*   However, numerous test files still have incorrect calls to `applyFunction` and `Apply`, resulting in build compilation errors (typically "cannot use token.Pos as *object.Environment" due to swapped arguments). I have been unable to resolve these cascading errors in the allotted time.

## TODO / Next Steps

The immediate and only priority is to get the code back into a buildable state. A methodical, one-at-a-time approach is required.

1.  **Systematically Fix Build Errors**:
    *   Run `go test -v ./symgo/...` to get a fresh, definitive list of build errors.
    *   Pick **one** failing file from the list (e.g., `symgo/evaluator/evaluator_test.go`).
    *   Read that file to get its current, exact content.
    *   Fix **only the first** incorrect call in that file using `replace_with_git_merge_diff`.
    *   Run `go test -v ./symgo/...` again. If the error for that line is gone, repeat the process for the next error in the same file.
    *   Once a file is clean, move to the next file in the build error list.
2.  **Verify `TestInterfaceBinding`**: Once the build is fixed, run the tests again, focusing on `TestInterfaceBinding`. It is hoped that the refactoring has fixed this test.
3.  **Address Regressions**: Systematically debug and fix any other test failures that may have been introduced.
