# Troubleshooting `minigo2` Import Handling and `go-scan` Analysis

This document provides a detailed retrospective of the work done to implement advanced import handling in `minigo2`, including an investigation into a suspected bug in the `go-scan` library.

### 1. Initial Goal & Misunderstanding

The primary task was to implement "Advanced Import Handling" as outlined in `TODO.md`, focusing on package caching and circular import detection.

My initial approach was flawed. I attempted to test circular imports by creating a `minigo2` script with a circular dependency between constant definitions. This was a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem, as it tested the evaluator's constant resolution logic rather than the package import mechanism. This flawed premise led me to incorrectly suspect a bug in the underlying `go-scan` library.

I previously stated: "I suspect that an unintentional recursive import resolution is happening when `FindSymbolInPackage` is called. I will investigate the `go-scan` source code in detail to determine if this is a bug in `go-scan` or an issue with how I am using it in `minigo2`." This hypothesis was incorrect and stemmed from my own faulty test case.

### 2. The `go-scan` Investigation: A Bug Was Not Found

I dedicated significant time to creating a minimal test case for a circular import directly within the `go-scan` library. This proved difficult because a true package import cycle (`a` imports `b`, and `b` imports `a`) is a compile-time error in Go, making it hard to test at the library level.

However, this deep dive into the `go-scan` source code was invaluable. It revealed that `go-scan` **already possesses a robust cycle detection mechanism**, particularly for resolving complex, interdependent type definitions across packages.

The conclusion was clear: **There was no bug in `go-scan`.** The issue was that my `minigo2` tests were too simplistic to ever trigger the code paths where `go-scan`'s cycle detection would activate.

### 3. Refactoring: Uncovering the Real Problem

The difficulty in writing these tests pointed to a significant design flaw in `minigo2`: the `Interpreter` was tightly coupled to the concrete `*goscan.Scanner` type. This made it nearly impossible to write effective unit tests, as I could not substitute a mock scanner to simulate different scenarios.

The most critical step in this entire process was **refactoring `minigo2` to depend on a `Scanner` interface.** This change decoupled the interpreter from the concrete scanner implementation, enabling proper, isolated testing with mocks. This was the key to making real progress.

### 4. Debugging the `PackageCache` Test: A Cascade of Errors

With mocking capabilities in place, I created `minigo2/minigo2_loader_test.go` to verify the package caching feature. This led to a series of cascading failures, each one uncovering a deeper issue in the test setup:

1.  **Syntax Error:** My first test script was syntactically invalid, with an `import` statement placed after a `var` declaration.
2.  **Runtime Error (`not a function`):** After fixing the script, the test failed because my mock scanner was returning a `ConstantInfo` (a string) for a symbol that the script was trying to call as a function.
3.  **Internal Inconsistency Error:** After correcting the mock to return a `FunctionInfo`, a more subtle "internal inconsistency" error appeared. This was the most insightful bug. It revealed that while I was replacing `interpreter.scanner` with my mock, the separate `interpreter.loader` object was still using the *original, real scanner*. This created two conflicting sources of truth about packages within the interpreter.
4.  **Go Modules Error (Current Blocker):** I finally fixed the mock injection logic by replacing the entire `loader` with a new one that used my mock. This corrected all previous logical errors, only to reveal a final build error: `no required module provides package...`. The Go tooling is currently failing to resolve a local package from within the test file.

### 5. Summary and Next Steps

The path to this solution was indirect, but it resulted in a much more precise understanding of the system and a more robust design.

*   **`go-scan` is not buggy;** it behaves as expected.
*   The real issue was the **low testability of `minigo2`**, which has now been fixed through refactoring to use interfaces.
*   The remaining task is to resolve the Go modules configuration issue. Once that final build error is fixed, the "Advanced Import Handling" feature, including its tests, should be complete and correct.
