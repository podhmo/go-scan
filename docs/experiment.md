## Experiment Proposal: Small-Scale File Movement Test

**Background:**

An issue was encountered while Jules was performing a package splitting task for `examples/minigo` (creating an `object` package and moving related definitions to it).

1.  **Initial Attempt:**
    *   Created the `examples/minigo/object` directory.
    *   Moved `examples/minigo/object.go` to `examples/minigo/object/object.go`.
    *   Changed the package declaration in `object/object.go` to `package object` and made type definitions exportable.
    *   Changed the type of the `Env` field in `UserDefinedFunction` and the `env` parameter in `BuiltinFunctionType` to `any` (to temporarily resolve dependency on the `Environment` type).
    *   Updated references to the `object` package in `interpreter.go`, `environment.go`, `builtin_fmt.go`, and `builtin_strings.go` (added prefixes, import statements, and type assertions).
    *   Updated test code in `interpreter_test.go` and `interpreter_struct_test.go`.

2.  **Test Execution Problem:**
    *   When `cd examples/minigo && go test ./...` was executed, a `Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution.` error occurred, and the changes were rolled back. This error is likely specific to the sandbox environment.
    *   Subsequently, when attempting to run tests in the initial state after rolling back the changes, executing `cd examples/minigo` or `go test ./examples/minigo/...` in `run_in_bash_session` consistently resulted in a `no such file or directory` error. This contradicts the situation where the `ls` command confirms the directory's existence, suggesting a potential issue with the test execution environment itself.

According to user information, "There might be a mechanism in the sandbox that detects the movement of files that existed at the time of cloning and restricts it, potentially making refactoring involving file moves difficult."

To isolate whether this file movement restriction actually causes errors (especially the `Failed to compute affected file count...` error) and how it relates to the current test execution environment problem (`no such file or directory`), the following phased experiment was conducted.

**Experiment Procedure:**

It is assumed that the current repository state has been rolled back to commit `820b0f4`, which was immediately after the initial request.

1.  **Verify Test Execution Environment:**
    *   First, run `go test ./...` in the `examples/minigo` directory to confirm that tests can be executed normally (i.e., no `no such file or directory` errors occur).
    *   If test execution itself fails here, this problem needs to be resolved before proceeding with the file movement experiment. In that case, report the error message.

2.  **Small-Scale File Movement:**
    *   Create the `examples/minigo/object` directory.
    *   Move the `examples/minigo/README.md` file to `examples/minigo/object/README.md`.

3.  **Verify Error Reproduction via Test Execution:**
    *   Run `go test ./...` again in the `examples/minigo` directory.
    *   Check if the `Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution.` error or any other error potentially caused by file movement occurs.

4.  **Report Results:**
    *   If an error occurs in step 3, report the error message in detail.
    *   If no error occurs in step 3, revert the changes (move `examples/minigo/object/README.md` back to `examples/minigo/README.md` and delete the `examples/minigo/object` directory) and report that no error occurred.

**Notes:**

*   The primary purpose of this experiment is to investigate file movement restrictions in the sandbox environment.
*   If the test execution environment is unstable (i.e., if problems occur in step 1), it will be difficult to proceed with this experiment.

## Experiment Results

This experiment was carried out as planned above.

**Issue Regarding Initial Working Directory:**

In the initial phase of the experiment (during file operations in step 2), file creation (`mkdir`) and file movement (using the `rename_file` tool, equivalent to `mv`) in `run_in_bash_session` failed with a `No such file or directory` error.
Since the `ls` command confirmed the existence of the target directories and files, it was initially suspected that the sandbox environment issue described in the "Background" section of `docs/experiment.md` had recurred.
However, upon checking the current working directory (CWD) of `run_in_bash_session` at the user's suggestion, it was found to be a subdirectory (`/app/examples/minigo`) instead of the repository root (`/app`).
After correcting the CWD to `/app` and reattempting the file operations, they succeeded. Therefore, it was concluded that the initial file operation errors were not due to a deep-seated sandbox issue but rather a misconfiguration of the CWD.

**File Movement and Test Execution Results:**

1.  **Verify Test Execution Environment (Step 1):**
    *   With the CWD set to `/app/examples/minigo`, `go test ./...` was executed. The tests completed successfully. No `no such file or directory` error occurred.

2.  **Small-Scale File Movement (Step 2):**
    *   With the CWD set to `/app`, the following operations were performed:
        *   `mkdir examples/minigo/object` (Succeeded)
        *   `rename_file("examples/minigo/README.md", "examples/minigo/object/README.md")` (Succeeded)

3.  **Verify Error Reproduction via Test Execution (Step 3):**
    *   With the CWD set to `/app/examples/minigo`, `go test ./...` was executed.
    *   As a result, the error message `Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution.` was displayed, and all changes were rolled back by the sandbox.

**Conclusion:**

It was confirmed that moving a single non-Go file, `examples/minigo/README.md`, to a subdirectory triggers the `Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution.` error when `go test ./...` is run, preventing the change.

This result strongly supports the user's hypothesis that "the sandbox has a mechanism to detect the movement of files present at clone time and restricts it." It appears that if the file structure within the repository is altered, even if it's not a `.go` file, test execution (or an associated sandbox check mechanism) is triggered and causes an error.

Therefore, when using Jules for file movements or package refactoring (especially those involving changes to directory structure in Go projects), this sandbox behavior must be taken into account. Even simple file moves can be rolled back by test execution, so countermeasures are necessary.

**Future Considerations:**

*   Verify if moving Go files and changing their content (e.g., package declarations) results in the same error or a different one.
*   Investigate whether there are ways to circumvent the sandbox's file movement restrictions (e.g., creating a new file, copying content, and deleting the old file, instead of moving directly).
*   If changes to `README.md` were permissible, attempt to move `.go` files (from the user's initial instruction). â†’ In this experiment, moving `README.md` itself caused an error, making this verification currently difficult.

This experiment confirmed that even moving a README.md file can cause an error. This is important knowledge for moving and refactoring Go files.
