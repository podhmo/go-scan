# Troubleshooting the Typo Fix

This document outlines the steps taken to debug the test failures that occurred after fixing the `Marshall`/`marshall` typos.

## Initial Problem

The initial request was to fix all instances of the typos `Marshall` and `marshall` to `Marshal` and `marshal` respectively. This included correcting the `derivingmarshall` annotation to `deriving:marshal`.

After correcting the typos and regenerating the code, the tests in `examples/derivingjson/integrationtest` started failing. The error message was `json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field ... of type ...`, which indicated that the custom `UnmarshalJSON` methods were not being generated for the structs in that package.

## Debugging Steps

I took the following steps to debug the issue:

1.  **Verified Typos**: I used `grep` multiple times to ensure that all instances of `marshall` and `unmarshall` were corrected. I also checked for typos in file and directory names.

2.  **Corrected Generator Logic**: I identified and fixed a bug in the `examples/derivingjson/gen/generate.go` file where the `fmt` package was being imported unconditionally, causing a compile error when only `MarshalJSON` was generated.

3.  **Cleaned and Regenerated Code**: I used `make clean` to remove all generated files and `make emit` to regenerate them. This was done multiple times to ensure that the generator was working with a clean slate.

4.  **Investigated Annotation Parsing**: I investigated the `scanner.TypeInfo.Annotation()` function to see if it was correctly parsing the annotations. I added tests for this function to cover various edge cases, including whitespace. The tests passed, indicating that the `Annotation` function was working as expected.

5.  **Isolated Generator Command**: I isolated the command for the `integrationtest` package from the `Makefile` and ran it separately to see the output. The output confirmed that the generator was being run with the correct files, but it was still not generating the `UnmarshalJSON` methods.

6.  **Reverted and Retried**: I reverted all my changes and started over from the beginning, being extra careful with the file paths and the order of operations. The issue persisted.

7.  **Attempted Different Generator Logic**: I tried changing the generator logic to use a different way of checking for the annotations. This did not solve the problem.

## Final State

The tests in `examples/derivingjson/integrationtest` are still failing. The root cause appears to be a bug in the `go-scan` library's ability to find type implementers within the `integrationtest` package. The generator correctly identifies the interface fields, but it does not find any structs that implement those interfaces. This is why the `UnmarshalJSON` methods are not being generated.

I have exhausted all my debugging strategies and I am unable to fix this issue. The original request to fix the typos has been fulfilled, but this underlying bug remains.

I have submitted the typo fixes on the `fix-marshall-typo` branch, with a note about the known issue. This documentation is on the `docs/troubleshooting-typo-fix` branch.
