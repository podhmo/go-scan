# Trouble with OpenAPI Generation Test Setup

## Context

I am working on implementing a feature to improve OpenAPI generation. The goals are:
1.  When a struct is used in multiple places, define it once in `components/schemas` and use `$ref` elsewhere.
2.  Ensure unique schema names for structs that have the same name but are in different packages.
3.  Ensure unique `operationId` for handler functions that have the same name but are in different packages.

## What I've Done

-   Modified `examples/docgen/openapi/model.go` to add the `Components` object to the `OpenAPI` struct.
-   Refactored the schema generation logic in `examples/docgen/patterns/patterns.go` to create and reference component schemas.
-   Updated the `operationId` generation in `examples/docgen/analyzer.go` to include a sanitized package path prefix.
-   Created a comprehensive test case under `examples/docgen/testdata/ref-and-rename` to cover all required scenarios, including name collisions for structs and handlers across different package paths.
-   Added a new test function `TestDocgen_refAndRename` to `examples/docgen/main_test.go`.

## The Problem

I am stuck trying to get the test `TestDocgen_refAndRename` to run correctly. The test consistently fails with a package resolution error, even after attempting multiple configurations based on other working tests in the same file.

The latest error is:
```
--- FAIL: TestDocgen_refAndRename (0.06s)
    main_test.go:443: failed to analyze package: error during entrypoint apply: /app/examples/docgen/testdata/ref-and-rename/api/api.go:15:31: could not scan package "ref-and-rename/actions": could not find directory for import path ref-and-rename/actions: import path "ref-and-rename/actions" could not be resolved. Current module is "ref-and-rename" (root: /app/examples/docgen/testdata/ref-and-rename)
```

## What I've Tried

1.  **Initial Approach**: Used full import paths from the main module root. This failed because the test runner (`go -C ./examples/docgen test`) changes the context.
2.  **`go.mod` and `WithWorkDir`**: Created a `go.mod` in the testdata directory (`testdata/ref-and-rename`) to make it a self-contained module. Used `goscan.WithWorkDir()` to point the scanner to this module's root. This also failed with a similar resolution error.
3.  **`go.mod` and `os.Chdir`**: Kept the `go.mod` and switched to using `os.Chdir()` to change the current working directory to the test module's root before analysis. This is a pattern used by other tests (`TestDocgen_withCustomPatterns`). This still resulted in a package resolution failure.

I seem to be fundamentally misunderstanding how the `go-scan` locator resolves packages within a temporary, test-specific module when the test is invoked via `go -C`. Despite replicating the patterns in other tests, my test case for `ref-and-rename` cannot locate its sub-packages (`api`, `actions`, etc.).

As requested, I will commit the code in its current, non-passing state to allow for external review.

## Resolution

The issue was resolved by addressing two separate problems in the test setup.

1.  **Incorrect Import Path**: The primary package resolution error was not due to a complex issue with `go-scan`'s locator, but a simple mistake in the test data. The file `examples/docgen/testdata/ref-and-rename/api/api.go` contained an import for `ref-and-rename/actions`, but the actual directory was named `pkg1`. Correcting the import path from `ref-and-rename/actions` to `ref-and-rename/pkg1` resolved the package scanning failure.

2.  **Empty Golden File**: After fixing the import path, the test failed with a new error: `failed to unmarshal want JSON: unexpected end of JSON input`. This was because the golden file for the test, `api.golden.json`, was present but completely empty. The test was attempting to parse the empty file as JSON, leading to the error.

The final solution was to run the test suite with the `-update` flag (`go -C ./examples/docgen test ./... -update`). This correctly generated the OpenAPI specification and populated the `api.golden.json` file. Subsequent test runs without the `-update` flag then passed successfully.
