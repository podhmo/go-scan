# Troubleshooting `minigo2` Import Handling

This document details the process of implementing and fixing the advanced import handling features in the `minigo2` interpreter, specifically focusing on dot (`.`) and blank (`_`) imports. The journey involved incorrect initial assumptions, a deep dive into the `go-scan` library, and a final, successful implementation in the interpreter's evaluator.

## 1. The Problem: Failing Import Tests

The initial goal was to implement the "Advanced Import Handling" tasks from the `TODO.md` file. The test suite for `minigo2` already contained test cases for dot and blank imports, but they were failing.

-   **Dot Import (`import . "strings"`)**: This test failed with an `identifier not found: ToUpper` error. This indicated that the symbols from the `strings` package were not being added to the main script's scope.
-   **Blank Import (`import _ "strings"`)**: This test was also failing, though its requirements are more subtle (it should simply succeed without error, assuming side effects like `init()` have run).

## 2. Initial Investigation and (Incorrect) Assumptions

My first approach was to diagnose why the imports were failing. I initially made a few incorrect assumptions:

-   **Circular Dependency Misunderstanding**: I spent time trying to create a test for circular dependencies by creating loops between constants within a single file. This was a flawed approach, as circular dependencies in Go occur between packages, not within them.
-   **Suspecting `go-scan`**: Because my initial tests were not correctly triggering the expected behavior, I incorrectly suspected that the underlying `go-scan` library might have a bug in its dependency resolution logic.

## 3. Correcting the Course: Verifying `go-scan`

To confirm or deny the suspected bug in `go-scan`, I created a dedicated, isolated test (`goscan_crosspkg_test.go`). This test created a temporary Go module on the filesystem with several interdependent packages, including a circular dependency.

The test **passed**. This was a critical turning point. It proved that `go-scan` was fully capable of:
-   Resolving types across multiple packages.
-   Correctly detecting and handling circular dependencies during its scanning and resolution phase.

This realization shifted the focus of the investigation away from the scanner library and toward the consumer of that library: the `minigo2` interpreter itself. The problem wasn't in the tool, but in how the tool was being used.

## 4. The Final, Correct Implementation

With `go-scan`'s capabilities confirmed, I analyzed the `minigo2` evaluator (`minigo2/evaluator/evaluator.go`) to understand how it handled `import` statements.

### The Root Cause

The issue was located in the `evalGenDecl` function, which processes declarations like `import`, `const`, `var`, and `type`. The original logic treated all imports identically: it created a `Package` object and stored it in the environment under a given name.

-   For `import "strings"`, it correctly created a package object named `strings`.
-   For `import . "strings"`, it incorrectly created a package object named `.`.
-   For `import _ "strings"`, it created a package object named `_`.

This approach was too simplistic and did not respect the special semantics of dot and blank imports.

### The Fix

The solution was to add specific logic within `evalGenDecl` to handle each import style correctly.

1.  **Add `SymbolRegistry.GetAllFor`**: The `SymbolRegistry` could look up single symbols but lacked a method to retrieve all symbols for a given package path. I added a new method, `GetAllFor`, to `minigo2/object/object.go` to enable this. This was crucial for the eager loading required by dot imports.

2.  **Modify `evalGenDecl` in `evaluator.go`**:
    -   **Dot Imports (`.`):** When `pkgName` is `.`, the new logic eagerly loads all symbols from the package into the *current* environment.
        -   It calls the new `registry.GetAllFor()` method to get all registered Go functions and variables.
        -   It calls `scanner.ScanPackage()` to parse the package's source and extract source-level definitions, such as constants.
        -   These symbols are then directly added to the current evaluation environment.
    -   **Blank Imports (`_`):** When `pkgName` is `_`, the logic now does nothing and simply continues to the next import spec. This is the correct behavior, as blank imports are for side-effects (`init()` functions), which are assumed to have already run in the interpreter's host Go environment.
    -   **Regular Imports:** The logic for regular imports (e.g., `import "strings"`) remained unchanged.

### Verification

After implementing these changes, I re-ran the entire test suite (`go test -v ./...`). The previously failing tests, including `TestGoInterop_Import/dot_import` and `TestGoInterop_Import/blank_import`, now passed successfully. This confirmed that the new logic correctly handled the special import cases. Finally, the `TODO.md` file was updated to mark the feature as complete.
