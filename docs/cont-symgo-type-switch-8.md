# Continuation 8: Stabilizing the Test Suite and Defining the Core Conflict

## Initial Prompt

The user requested that I continue the work from `docs/cont-symgo-type-switch-7.md`, which was to fix the remaining test failures related to interface type assertions.

## Roadblocks & Key Discoveries

My session began by attempting to implement the "conditional unwrapping" logic as planned. However, upon running the tests, I discovered that the test suite for `symgo/evaluator` was in a completely broken state. Nearly every test was failing with errors like `main function not found in package environment`.

This was a major, unexpected roadblock. Before I could fix the feature, I had to repair the entire test suite.

### Action: Test Suite Repair

I deduced that a recent refactoring in the evaluator—likely the introduction of isolated package environments via a `pkgCache`—had not been reflected in the test files. The tests were incorrectly assuming that the initial `Eval` pass would populate a locally-created environment, when in fact it populates the evaluator's internal, canonical environment for that package.

I systematically went through the following files and corrected the test harness logic to fetch the correct package environment from the evaluator after the `Eval` pass:
- `evaluator_typeswitch_test.go`
- `evaluator_slice_test.go`
- `evaluator_unary_expr_test.go`
- `evaluator_unary_test.go`
- `evaluator_variadic_test.go`
- `integration_test.go`
- `evaluator_label_test.go`
- `evaluator_range_test.go`
- `evaluator_if_typeswitch_test.go`
- `evaluator_shallow_scan_test.go`
- `evaluator_test.go` (specifically `TestEvalBlockStatement`)

This effort successfully fixed the widespread test harness failures and allowed the true, underlying bugs to be identified.

### Key Discovery: The Core Architectural Conflict

With a stable test suite, I was able to re-apply fixes for the interface assertion logic. This revealed a fundamental conflict in the evaluator's design concerning how it resolves method calls.

1.  **The "Static Type" Requirement:** For a variable `s` declared as an interface (`var s io.Writer`), a method call `s.Write()` must be treated as a symbolic call on the *interface*. The evaluator should not immediately resolve it to the method of the concrete type that `s` might hold (e.g., `*bytes.Buffer`). This is required to correctly analyze code that relies on interface contracts. Tests like `TestEval_InterfaceMethodCall_OnConcreteType` enforce this.

2.  **The "Dynamic Type" Requirement:** For a variable `v` that has been narrowed using a type assertion or type switch (`v := i.(MyStruct)`), a method or field access (`v.MyField`) must be resolved against the narrowed, concrete type (`MyStruct`). This requires "unwrapping" the placeholder for `v` to get to the original concrete object. Tests like `TestIfOk_FieldAccess` enforce this.

**The conflict is this:** The evaluator's current mechanism for resolving identifiers (`evalIdent`) eagerly fetches the concrete, dynamic value of a variable. This satisfies requirement #2 but breaks #1 by throwing away the static type information of the variable. My attempts to fix #1 by making `evalSelectorExpr` aware of the static type broke #2, as it interfered with the type-narrowing logic in switches.

## How Each Approach Fails

-   **Approach A: Eagerly Evaluate Variables (Current State)**
    -   **How it works:** `evalIdent` always returns the concrete `object.Value` of a variable.
    -   **What it breaks:** `TestEval_InterfaceMethodCall_OnConcreteType`. A call on an interface-typed variable is immediately resolved to the concrete type's method, bypassing the symbolic interface dispatch the test expects.
    -   **Why:** The static type `io.Writer` is lost; only the dynamic type `*bytes.Buffer` is seen by `evalSelectorExpr`.

-   **Approach B: Preserve Static Type in `evalSelectorExpr`**
    -   **How it works:** Add special logic to `evalSelectorExpr` to check if the receiver `x` in `x.M()` is a variable with a static interface type. If so, perform a symbolic interface method lookup.
    -   **What it breaks:** `TestTypeSwitch_Complex`. Inside a `case MyStruct:`, the narrowed variable `v` has the concrete type `MyStruct`. The special logic incorrectly treats it as an interface because the *original* variable being switched on was an interface, leading to failed method lookups.
    -   **Why:** The logic is not sophisticated enough to distinguish between a regular interface variable and a variable that has been narrowed by a type switch.

-   **Approach C: Change `evalIdent` to not force-evaluate**
    -   **How it works:** Modify `evalIdent` to return the `*object.Variable` itself, and teach `evalSelectorExprForObject` to handle it.
    -   **What it breaks:** `TestEvalBlockStatement`. The test expects the final value of a block, but now receives the variable object, causing a type mismatch in the test's assertion.
    -   **Why:** This is a deep architectural change. While likely the "most correct" path, it requires many downstream consumers of `Eval`'s output to be updated to handle receiving a variable instead of a value.

## Conclusion

The session was successful in repairing the test suite and identifying the core architectural challenge. Instead of attempting a complex fix, the decision was made to document this trade-off and submit the repaired tests as a valuable checkpoint. The next step will require a more careful, architectural approach to solving the static vs. dynamic dispatch conflict.
