# Continuation 7: Finalizing `symgo` Type Switch and Assertion Logic

## Initial Prompt

(Translated from Japanese)
"Please read one task from TODO.md and implement it. If necessary, break it down into sub-tasks. [...] The task to choose should be a symgo task. The origin is docs/plan-symgo-type-switch.md, and the implementation itself is a continuation of docs/cont-symgo-type-switch-6.md. [...] First, please organize the continuation documents from docs/cont-symgo-type-switch.md to docs/cont-symgo-type-switch-6.md and reflect the results of trial and error in the planning document. The purpose here is to grasp the progress status and organize what challenges exist. There is also the intention to narrow the search space by recording incorrect assumptions and avoiding them."

## Goal

The goal is to complete the `symgo` type-switch/assertion feature by fixing the remaining test failures. This requires a deep understanding of the feature's implementation history to avoid repeating past mistakes. The main task is to synthesize the key learnings from previous attempts and apply a correct, nuanced fix.

## Initial Implementation Attempt

My session began by attempting to fix the failing tests in `symgo/evaluator_test.go`. The failures were related to "pruned paths" in type assertions. My initial hypothesis was that the pruning logic itself, which relied on a `SymbolicPlaceholder.Original` field, was fundamentally flawed.

Based on this, my first action was to **remove** the usage of the `Original` field entirely from `evalTypeSwitchStmt` and `evalAssignStmt`. This change successfully made the `evaluator_test` unit tests pass. However, as the user pointed out by asking me to review the history, this was a step backward. It papered over the bug and discarded the hard-won progress from previous sessions.

## Roadblocks & Key Discoveries

The main "roadblock" was my initial failure to appreciate the implementation history. Following the user's direction, I read through all six previous continuation documents (`cont-symgo-type-switch-1.md` through `6.md`). This was the key discovery that put me on the correct path.

The history revealed a clear pattern:
1.  The `Original` field is **necessary** to link a type-narrowed variable back to its concrete value. This is the only way to access fields and methods on assertions to **concrete types**.
2.  The logic that uses the `Original` field (the "unwrapping" logic in `evalSelectorExpr`) was too aggressive. It broke assertions to **interface types** because it prevented the evaluator's symbolic interface method resolution from working.

The crucial insight, first hypothesized in `cont-symgo-type-switch-3.md`, is that the unwrapping must be **conditional**. It should only happen if the target of the type assertion is a concrete type (like a struct), not an interface.

## Major Refactoring Effort

My own initial refactoring was a misstep (removing the `Original` field usage). After reviewing the history, I have restored the code to its previous state, where the `Original` field is populated. The *next* step will be to perform the correct, nuanced refactoring.

## Current Status

The code has been restored to the state at the beginning of my session. The `Original` field is being populated in `evalTypeSwitchStmt` and `evalAssignStmt`. The tests for assertions to concrete types are passing, but tests for assertions to interface types (`TestInterfaceBinding`, etc.) are failing with "pruned path" errors, as expected from the historical analysis.

I now have a clear understanding of the problem and the solution.

## TODO / Next Steps

The path forward is to implement the conditional unwrapping logic that was hypothesized in `cont-3` but never successfully implemented.

1.  **Modify `evalSelectorExpr`**: In `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go`, locate the pruning/unwrapping logic that checks for `placeholder.Original != nil`.
2.  **Add Conditional Check**: Before unwrapping, inspect the placeholder's type (`placeholder.FieldType()` or `placeholder.TypeInfo()`).
3.  **Implement Logic**:
    *   If the placeholder's type is a **concrete type** (e.g., a struct), proceed with the existing logic to perform the compatibility check and unwrap to `placeholder.Original`.
    *   If the placeholder's type is an **interface type**, **skip** the unwrapping logic entirely. The execution should proceed with the symbolic placeholder itself, allowing `evalSymbolicSelection` to handle the interface method call.
4.  **Verify**: Run all tests in `symgo/evaluator/...`. This change should fix the remaining interface-related test failures while keeping the concrete-type tests passing.
5.  **Submit**: Submit the final, correct implementation.
