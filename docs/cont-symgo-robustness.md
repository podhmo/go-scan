### Initial Prompt

The user wants to fix a failing test, `TestAnalyzeMinigoPackage`, in the `symgo` package, which is part of the "symgo: Improve Robustness and Reduce Configuration" task. The test is failing with a `panic: nil` error.

### Goal

The primary objective is to identify the root cause of the `panic: nil` error in the `TestAnalyzeMinigoPackage` test and implement a robust fix that ensures the symbolic execution engine can correctly analyze the `minigo` package.

### Initial Implementation Attempt

My first hypothesis was that the symbolic execution engine was failing to create a proper symbolic placeholder for a missing function argument in the `minigo.New` function. This was based on the observation that the panic occurred deep within the symbolic evaluation of this function.

To address this, I modified `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go` to ensure that when a `SymbolicPlaceholder` was created, it was always initialized with the correct type information. I believed this would prevent a nil pointer dereference when the engine attempted to access type properties of the placeholder. I applied a patch and re-ran the tests.

### Roadblocks & Key Discoveries

The initial fix failed to resolve the issue; the test failed with the exact same `panic: nil` error. This proved that my initial hypothesis was incorrect.

Upon closer inspection of the test logs, I discovered "could not find directory for import path" errors for standard library packages like `fmt` and `go/token`. This was a critical discovery. It led me to a new hypothesis: the symbolic engine's scanner was not being initialized with the correct Go module context (module root and path). Without this context, the engine couldn't resolve external package dependencies, leading to incomplete type information and the eventual nil panic.

I realized that the test was using a minimal, isolated `goscan.Scanner` instance. The correct approach was to use the main `goscan.New` factory from the project root, which would configure the scanner with the necessary module information to resolve standard library and other external packages.

A second, related discovery was that the symbolic evaluator could not access fields of embedded structs. During the analysis of `minigo`, the evaluator needed to resolve fields from an embedded `bytes.Buffer`, but it was failing to do so. This required a change to the `object.Variable` struct and the evaluator's field lookup logic.

### Major Refactoring Effort

Based on these discoveries, I undertook a significant refactoring:

1.  **Scanner Initialization:** In `symgo/integration_test/minigo_analysis_test.go`, I replaced the isolated `goscan.Scanner` with one created by the project's central `goscan.New` factory. This ensured the scanner was aware of the Go module root and could correctly locate and parse all necessary package dependencies.

2.  **Embedded Field Support:**
    *   I added an `Embedded` boolean field to the `symgo/object.Variable` struct to flag fields originating from embedded structs.
    *   I updated the field lookup logic in `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go` to recursively search through embedded structs when a field is not found on the parent struct. This allowed the evaluator to correctly resolve fields like `buf.Len` from the embedded `bytes.Buffer` in the `minigo` test case.

After applying these two changes together, the `TestAnalyzeMinigoPackage` test passed successfully.

### Current Status

The refactoring is complete, and the code contains the necessary logic to pass the test. I have successfully run the test and confirmed that it passes with my changes. The next step is to formalize these changes by updating the project's TODO list and submitting the code.
