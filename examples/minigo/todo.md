- [ ] Types
  - [ ] More specific integer types (int8, int32, int64, uint etc.)
  - [ ] Floating point numbers

    - [ ] Support for recognizing and enforcing enums from imported Go packages using `go-scan`
      - [ ] Investigate `go-scan`'s constant information for imported packages.

    - [ ] Basic static type checking for variable assignments based on go-scan TypeInfo.
    - [ ] Type checking for function call arguments against parameter types from go-scan FunctionInfo.
    - [ ] Type checking for binary operator operands.
- [ ] Pointers
- [ ] Multiple return values from functions
- [ ] Variadic functions (for user-defined functions, built-ins have a simple form)
- [ ] Imports & Package Handling
  - [x] Basic import statement parsing (`import "path"` and `import alias "path"`) (Unsupported forms like . and _ are rejected)
  - [x] Loading imported package constants (`pkg.MyConst`) via `go-scan`. (As described in README)

    - [ ] Extract imported global variable information using `go-scan`.
    - [ ] Make imported global variables accessible in the interpreter.
  - [ ] Investigate `go-scan`'s Lazy Import (`PackageResolver`) for multi-file/package support in `minigo` (Future - see go-scan Integration section)
  - [ ] (Low Priority) Consider support for dot imports (e.g., `import . "mypkg"`)
  - [ ] (Low Priority) Consider support for blank imports (e.g., `import _ "mypkg"` for side-effects if init functions were supported)
  - [x] Update README.md to reflect current import capabilities (constants and functions).
  - [ ] Clarify and document behavior for imports when `go.mod` is not found or when script is outside a module (relates to `trouble.md`).
  - [ ] Consider strategy for true Go standard library imports (e.g., `import "os"`) beyond current built-in shims (relates to `trouble.md`).
  - [ ] Define and implement `const` declarations in minigo scripts (currently only `var`). (from environment.go TODO)
  - [ ] Support for built-in global variables (e.g., `iota`, `nil` if not already fully supported). (from environment.go TODO)

## Standard Library / Built-ins
- [x] `fmt.Sprintf` (basic implementation)
- [x] `strings.Join` (refactored to accept slice of strings and separator)

  - [ ] Test modifying struct fields (e.g., `p.X = 30`) once LHS of assignment can be SelectorExpr. (from interpreter_struct_test.go TODO)
  - [ ] Test returning struct from main and checking its value directly from LoadAndRun's result. (from interpreter_struct_test.go TODO)
  - [ ] Test struct definition within a function (local type declarations). (from interpreter_struct_test.go TODO)
  - [ ] Test for duplicate field names in struct literal (e.g. `Point{X:1, X:2}`). (from interpreter_struct_test.go TODO)
  - [ ] Test using a non-struct type in a composite literal (e.g. `var x int; _ = x{}`). (from interpreter_struct_test.go TODO)
  - [ ] Test empty struct literal for non-empty struct (e.g. `type P struct {X int}; _ = P{}`). (from interpreter_struct_test.go TODO)
  - [ ] Test for `nil` keyword/object and its behavior, especially with map access returning `NULL`.
- [ ] Support for multiple files / packages (related to Lazy Import above)
- [ ] Debugger support (very long term)
- [ ] Better type system for `Object` interface (e.g. using generics if Go 2, or more specific interfaces)
  - [ ] Implement `Hashable` interface for all relevant object types that can be map keys. (from object.go TODO)
  - [ ] Implement `Callable` interface for function objects (UserDefinedFunction, BuiltinFunction). (from object.go TODO)
- [ ] **Built-in Auto-generation (`autogen-builtin.md`) Review**
  - [x] Update `autogen-builtin.md` to reflect that MiniGo now possesses `object.Array` and `object.Slice` types, making its statement about "MiniGo lacks array types" outdated. (Done in previous session)
  - [x] Refactored `strings.Join` to accept a MiniGo slice/array and a separator, aligning with auto-generation ideals and MiniGo's current type capabilities.
- [ ] **Reflection / Introspection Features (`minigo/inspect` package - based on improvement.md)**
  - [ ] Implement `minigo/inspect` package as a built-in or standard library package.
  - [ ] Design and implement `ImportedFunction` object type in `object.go` to hold info about imported Go functions (distinct from callable `UserDefinedFunction`).
  - [ ] Modify `evalSelectorExpr` to create `ImportedFunction` objects for imported functions.
  - [ ] Modify `evalCallExpr` to disallow direct calls to `ImportedFunction` objects.
  - [ ] Implement `inspect.GetFunctionInfo(fnSymbol)`:
    - [ ] Takes an `ImportedFunction` object (or perhaps a callable `UserDefinedFunction` representing an import).
    - [ ] Uses `go-scan` data to populate `FunctionInfo` struct (Go side).
    - [ ] Converts `FunctionInfo` to a minigo map or struct-like object.
  - [ ] Implement `inspect.GetTypeInfo(typeName string)`:
    - [ ] Takes a type name string (e.g., "pkg.MyType", "int").
    - [ ] Uses `go-scan` to get details for the type.
    - [ ] Populates `TypeInfo` struct (Go side) with kinds, fields, methods, etc.
    - [ ] Converts `TypeInfo` to a minigo map or struct-like object.
    - [ ] Handle recursive types and potential cycles.
  - [ ] Implement `inspect.GetPackageInfo(pkgPathOrSymbol)`:
    - [ ] Takes a package path string or a symbol from a package.
    - [ ] Uses `go-scan` to get overall package details.
    - [ ] Populates `PackageInfo` struct (Go side) with imports, constants, variables, function names, type names.
    - [ ] Converts `PackageInfo` to a minigo map or struct-like object.
  - [ ] Define Go structs for `FunctionInfo`, `ParamInfo`, `ReturnInfo`, `TypeInfo`, `FieldInfo`, `MethodInfo`, `PackageInfo`, `ValueInfo` as proposed in `improvement.md`.
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling for all `inspect` functions (symbol not found, type mismatch, etc.).
  - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for the `minigo/inspect` package functionality.

## Code Quality & Refactoring
- [x] Review error handling consistency (e.g. when to return `Error` object vs. `error`) - Improved with `Error` object.
- [x] Refactor `eval` function if it becomes too large (e.g. by node type) - *ongoing, new eval functions added for new node types*.
- [ ] Improve comments and documentation within the code
- [x] Confirm and remove `findFunction` in `interpreter.go` as it appears to be dead code after go-scan integration. (Confirmed as unused and effectively dead code due to current direct AST processing for main script and go-scan for imports)

## go-scan Integration
- [x] **Integrate `go-scan` for initial parsing phase**
  - [x] Modify `LoadAndRun` to use `go-scan`'s `Scanner` to get `PackageInfo`.
  - [x] Adapt `minigo` to extract function definitions (`*ast.FuncDecl` or body) from `PackageInfo` (or `*ast.File` if provided by `go-scan`).
  - [x] Adapt `minigo` to extract global variable declarations from `PackageInfo` (using `*ast.File` from `pkgInfo.AstFiles` currently).
  - [x] Ensure error reporting (`formatErrorWithContext`) correctly uses `FileSet` and positional info from `go-scan`.
- [ ] **Contribute to or discuss `go-scan` enhancements**
  - [x] Propose/discuss `PackageInfo` retaining `*ast.File` for scanned files. (Implemented)
  - [x] Propose/discuss `FunctionInfo` directly referencing `*ast.FuncDecl`. (Implemented)
  - [ ] Propose/discuss `PackageInfo` aggregating global variable declarations. (`minigo` currently iterates `importPkgInfo.Constants` and `importPkgInfo.Variables` if go-scan provided them; this is a form of aggregation by go-scan already. Need to clarify if more specific aggregation is desired from go-scan, e.g., pre-resolved values or types.)
    - [ ] (If go-scan supports it) Adapt `minigo` to use aggregated global variable information from `PackageInfo` directly.
  - [ ] Propose/discuss `PackageInfo` aggregating global variable type and value information for easier import. (`minigo`'s `loadPackageIfNeeded` currently processes `importPkgInfo.Constants` and attempts to parse their values and types. This item likely refers to `go-scan` providing more direct type/value info to simplify minigo's import logic.)
- [ ] **Investigate `go-scan`'s Lazy Import (`PackageResolver`) for multi-file/package support in `minigo` (Future)**
  - This relates to "Imports & Package Handling" in "Advanced Language Features" and "Support for multiple files / packages" in "Interpreter Internals & Tooling".
