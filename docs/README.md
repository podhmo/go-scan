# docs

Each of these documents is not for users, but for developers (currently just me).
This is a text repository for tiny specification-driven development using jules.

Documents are differentiated by filename prefix 

1. analysis- These are files for exploratory analysis and testing of things that may or may not be feasible.
2. plan- these are A document about the implementation plan and specifications of a task. This is linked to TODO.md.
3. trouble- These are temporary records of issues and obstacles encountered during implementation. These files are used to pass along the implementation and to debug or reimplement.
4. summary- These are useful summaries of knowledge
   
>[!NOTE]
>The text files here are generated by AI and are extremely exaggerated. They often contain excessively eloquent expressions(For example, something ordinary or insignificant is sometimes described as 'sophisticated.').
