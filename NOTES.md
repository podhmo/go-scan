# Debugging Notes: Mismatched Package Name Type Resolution

## Summary of Progress

The goal is to fix an issue where the `symgo` symbolic execution engine fails to resolve types from imported packages when the package name differs from its import path (e.g., `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` which is `package yaml`).

Here's what I've done so far:

1.  **Implemented Placeholder-based Evaluation**: Based on user feedback, I modified the core evaluation logic. Instead of erroring on undefined identifiers, the evaluator now creates a `SymbolicPlaceholder` object, allowing analysis to continue.
2.  **Corrected Package Name Guessing**: I found and fixed a bug in `evalImportSpec` that was incorrectly guessing package names from versioned import paths (e.g., guessing `v2` instead of `yaml`).
3.  **Added Type Resolution**: I enhanced `evalSelectorExpr` so that when it encounters a package (like `yaml`), it now correctly searches for type definitions (like `Node`) within that package, not just functions and constants.
4.  **Fixed Regressions**: The above changes caused some regressions in tests related to shallow scanning and type conversions. I've addressed these by making the `applyFunction` logic more nuanced in how it handles placeholders, and those tests are now passing again.

## Current Status & The Problem

Despite these fixes, the primary test case, `TestMismatchedImportPackageName`, is still failing with the exact same error: `return value has no type info`.

This is where I'm stuck. My understanding of the code's data flow is as follows:
*   The `yaml` package is correctly identified.
*   The `Node` type within it is correctly located.
*   The `TypeInfo` for `yaml.Node` is correctly assigned to the `*object.Variable` representing the `node` variable in the test code.
*   When `node` is returned, its `TypeInfo` should be propagated to the final return value object.

Since the test is still failing, there must be a flaw in this chain of events that I am consistently missing. I've hit the point where I'm going in circles, and a fresh perspective would be invaluable.
