# Trouble Shooting: Inspect/Dry-Run Feature Integration Tests

## Problem

The new integration tests for the `deriving-all` CLI tool, located in `examples/deriving-all/main_cli_test.go`, are failing with the following error:

`package directory ... is outside the module root ...`

## Context

The tests are designed to execute the CLI tool as a subprocess to verify the behavior of the new `--inspect` and `--dry-run` flags. The test helper function (`runCLI`) uses `exec.Command` to run the test binary.

The failure occurs because:
1. The test creates a temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp/TestDryRun...`) and populates it with a `go.mod` file and source files.
2. The `runCLI` helper executes the test binary, which in turn runs the `deriving-all` `main()` function.
3. The `deriving-all` tool initializes the `go-scan` scanner. The scanner correctly identifies the module root based on the location of the running tool, which is `/app/examples/deriving-all`.
4. The scanner is then asked to scan the temporary directory. It determines that this directory is outside the module root it identified, leading to the path resolution error.

## Proposed Solution

The issue can be resolved by making the test execution self-contained within the temporary directory. The `runCLI` helper function in `main_cli_test.go` should be modified to set the working directory of the executed command to the temporary directory created for the test.

### Change required in `examples/deriving-all/main_cli_test.go`:

```go
// in runCLI helper function
func runCLI(t *testing.T, dir string, args ...string) (string, string, error) {
	cmd := exec.Command(os.Args[0], args...)
	cmd.Env = append(os.Environ(), "GO_TEST_SUBPROCESS=1")
    // Set the working directory to the temp dir
	cmd.Dir = dir

	var stdout, stderr bytes.Buffer
	cmd.Stdout = &stdout
	cmd.Stderr = &stderr

	err := cmd.Run()
	return stdout.String(), stderr.String(), err
}

// And in the test cases, change the argument from the directory path to "."
// since the command will be running inside that directory.
// For example:
args := []string{"--dry-run", "."}
stdout, stderr, err := runCLI(t, dir, args...)
```

This change will ensure that when the `go-scan` scanner initializes, it will find the `go.mod` file within the temporary directory and correctly identify it as the module root, thus resolving the pathing issue.
