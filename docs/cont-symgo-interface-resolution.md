### Summary of Interface Resolution Issue

This document tracks the investigation into a failing set of tests related to interface resolution in the `symgo` package, specifically `TestInterfaceResolution` and `TestInterfaceBinding`.

### Initial Investigation: Method Set Logic

The initial hypothesis was that the `isImplementer` function in `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go` did not correctly handle Go's method set rules. Specifically, it did not account for the fact that a type `T` can satisfy an interface even if its methods have a pointer receiver (`*T`).

To address this, the following actions were taken:
1.  **New Tests Added**: Two new tests, `TestInterfaceResolutionWithPointerReceiver` and `TestInterfaceResolutionWithValueReceiver`, were added to `symgo/symgo_interface_resolution_test.go` to create minimal, focused reproductions of the issue for both pointer and value receiver cases.
2.  **`isImplementer` Patched**: The `isImplementer` function was patched to check for methods on both the value type (`T`) and a synthetic pointer type (`*T`).

The updated `isImplementer` function is now considered correct:
```go
// isImplementer checks if a given concrete type implements an interface.
func (e *Evaluator) isImplementer(ctx context.Context, concreteType *scanner.TypeInfo, interfaceType *scanner.TypeInfo) bool {
    if concreteType == nil || interfaceType == nil || interfaceType.Interface == nil {
        return false
    }

    // For every method in the interface...
    for _, ifaceMethodInfo := range interfaceType.Interface.Methods {
        // ...find a matching method in the concrete type.
        // A concrete type T can implement an interface method with a *T receiver.
        // So we need to check both T and *T.
        concreteMethodInfo := e.accessor.findMethodInfoOnType(ctx, concreteType, ifaceMethodInfo.Name)

        if concreteMethodInfo == nil && !strings.HasPrefix(concreteType.Name, "*") {
            // If not found on T, check on *T.
            // Create a synthetic pointer type for the check.
            pointerType := *concreteType
            pointerType.Name = "*" + concreteType.Name
            // This is a shallow copy, but it should be sufficient for the accessor.
            concreteMethodInfo = e.accessor.findMethodInfoOnType(ctx, &pointerType, ifaceMethodInfo.Name)
        }

        if concreteMethodInfo == nil {
            return false // Method not found
        }

        // ... (signature comparison logic remains the same) ...
    }
    return true
}
```

### Deeper Issue Discovered: Package Discovery in `Finalize`

Despite the fix to `isImplementer`, all related tests continue to fail.

The investigation revealed that the root cause is not in the implementation check itself, but in the `Finalize` function's type discovery mechanism. `Finalize` works by:
1.  Collecting all struct and interface types from packages in its `e.seenPackages` map.
2.  Building a map of which structs implement which interfaces.
3.  Connecting recorded interface method calls to their concrete implementations.

The problem is that the in-memory packages created by `scantest` for the test cases are never added to the `e.seenPackages` map. As a result, `Finalize` runs with an empty set of types and cannot find any interface implementations.

### Next Steps

The immediate task of fixing the receiver handling logic in `isImplementer` is complete. The next step is to address the package discovery issue.

**Recommendation:** Modify the `symgo.Interpreter` or the `scantest` test harness to ensure that all packages scanned during a test run are registered in the `e.seenPackages` map before `Finalize` is called. This will allow `Finalize` to correctly discover the types and resolve interface implementations.
