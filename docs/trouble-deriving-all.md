# Investigation: `deriving-all` E2E Test Failure and Scanner Contradictions

This document provides a final, detailed analysis of a bug found in the `deriving-all` example. It explains the evolution of my understanding, the contradictions discovered, and the final, most likely correct, hypothesis.

## Part 1: The Initial Problem

-   **Symptom**: The `make -C examples/deriving-all e2e` command failed with the error `json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field Event.data of type models.EventData`.
-   **Analysis**: This error indicated that the code generator failed to produce a custom `UnmarshalJSON` method that could correctly handle the `EventData` interface. This typically happens when the generator cannot identify all the concrete types that implement the interface.

## Part 2: Detailed Analysis of Hypotheses & Contradictions

My investigation proceeded through two main hypotheses. The first was proven incorrect by new information from the user, leading to the second, more accurate one.

### Hypothesis 1: Multi-File Cache Poisoning (Incorrect)

This was my initial mental model for the bug.

-   **Basis for this hypothesis**: My initial reading of `goscan.go` showed that the `goscan.Scanner` has two caching mechanisms (`visitedFiles` and `packageCache`). I saw that `ScanPackage` respected the `visitedFiles` cache and could return a partial `PackageInfo`, which it would then write to the `packageCache`. The `deriving-all` tool calls multiple generators, so I theorized that one part of the process could partially scan a package, "poisoning" the cache with incomplete information that a later part of the process would then incorrectly use.
-   **Why it was wrong**: This entire model was predicated on the interaction between multiple files within a package. The user clarified a critical piece of information I had missed: **the input for the failing e2e test was a single file** (`models.go`). In a single-file scenario, the logic of skipping already-visited files is irrelevant. This invalidated my entire "cache poisoning" theory and all the fixes based on it.

### Hypothesis 2: Single-File Declaration-Order Dependency (Correct)

This hypothesis was formed based on the user's crucial feedback that the input was a single file.

-   **Basis for this hypothesis**: If the input is a single file, the problem must be internal to how that one file is processed. I re-analyzed `scanner/scanner.go` (the low-level scanner) and focused on the `scanGoFiles` function. I observed that it processes the file's declarations (`Decls`) sequentially, in the order they appear in the source code.
-   **Why the current code cannot handle this**: The `deriving-all` use case involves an interface field (`EventData`). To correctly generate code for this, the scanner must know which structs implement this interface. In `models.go`, the `Event` struct (which *uses* the interface) is defined before the methods (`func (UserCreated) isEventData()`) that actually satisfy the interface.
    Because the current implementation is **single-pass**, when it processes the `Event` struct declaration, it has not yet processed the method declarations that appear later in the file. Therefore, at that moment, the `PackageInfo` object being built is incomplete. Any attempt to resolve the `EventData` interface and find its implementers at this stage is doomed to fail.
-   **Why a refactoring is necessary**: A single-pass scanner is fundamentally unable to solve this problem reliably. The only architecturally sound solution is a **multi-pass approach** within the scanner:
    1.  **Pass 1 (Declarations):** Walk the entire AST of the package's files and create placeholder `TypeInfo` and `FunctionInfo` objects for all top-level declarations. At the end of this pass, the `PackageInfo` contains a complete "table of contents" of all symbols in the package.
    2.  **Pass 2 (Details & Resolution):** Re-iterate through the collected symbols. Now, when processing the details of the `Event` struct, the `PackageInfo` already knows about the existence of the `isEventData` methods. The type resolution and `Implements` checks can now succeed because they have a complete view of the package.
-   **My Final Action**: My final attempt was to implement this multi-pass refactoring. This involved significant changes to `scanner/scanner.go` and `scanner/models.go`. However, this deep architectural change caused a number of regressions in other unit tests (related to generics, constants, etc.) that I was unable to fully resolve in the allotted time.

## Conclusion

The bug in `deriving-all` is not a simple caching issue, but a fundamental architectural problem in the low-level scanner (`scanner/scanner.go`). It uses a single-pass traversal, which makes it unable to handle common Go patterns where types and interfaces are used before their implementing methods are declared within the same file. The correct solution is to refactor `scanner/scanner.go` to a multi-pass system. While my attempt at this refactoring was incomplete, it remains the correct path forward for a robust solution. This document serves as a record of this investigation to aid future work on this complex issue.
