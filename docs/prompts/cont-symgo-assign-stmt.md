# Continuing `symgo` Implementation: Assignment Statements

## Initial Prompt

The user requested to implement a task from `TODO.md`, with a focus on `symgo` tasks. The most logical next step was to implement proper handling for `ast.AssignStmt`, as this was a fundamental missing piece in the evaluator.

## Thinking Process

1.  **Initial Goal**: My initial understanding was that I needed to implement the `ast.AssignStmt` evaluation logic from scratch. The primary goal was to make basic assignment forms (`=`, `:=`) work.

2.  **Test-Driven Approach**: To validate this, I began by creating a new test file, `symgo/evaluator/assign_stmt_test.go`, with simple test cases.
    -   **Immediate Discovery**: This immediately failed to compile due to a circular dependency. The `evaluator` package could not import the main `symgo` package (which provides the interpreter and scanner).
    -   **Correction**: I moved the tests to a separate `symgo/integration_test` package, a standard Go pattern to resolve this issue. This required refactoring the tests to use the `symgotest` framework, which turned out to be a more robust approach for testing the evaluator.

3.  **The Refactoring and the Cascade of Regressions**:
    -   I created a new `evaluator_stmt.go` file and added a handler for `ast.AssignStmt` in the evaluator's main `Eval` function. This centralized the logic.
    -   **Critical Realization**: As soon as this was done, a vast number of *existing* tests across the `symgo` and `evaluator` packages began to fail. This was a clear signal that my initial assumption was wrong. The system was not *missing* assignment logic; rather, the logic was scattered implicitly across other parts of the evaluator (e.g., `evalIdent`, `evalCallExpr`). My attempt to centralize it had broken these implicit assumptions.
    -   The task had now transformed from "implementing a new feature" to "refactoring existing logic and fixing the resulting regressions."

4.  **Debugging the Regressions - Uncovering Core Concepts**:
    -   **Scoping (`var` vs. `:=`)**: The first major bug was that `var x int` declarations were not being correctly registered in the local scope. I found that `evalGenDecl` was using `env.Set` (which searches all scopes) instead of `env.SetLocal` (which only affects the current scope). Correcting this was the first step.
    -   **Interface Type Tracking**: The most significant and difficult challenge was related to interface variables. Tests like `TestEval_InterfaceMethodCall_AcrossControlFlow` failed because the evaluator was losing track of the concrete types assigned to an interface.
        -   **Problem**: In `var i Animal = &Dog{}`, the variable `i` should have a static type of `Animal`, but it also needs to "remember" that it currently holds a `*Dog`. My initial refactoring was only tracking one of these, causing failures.
        -   **Solution (Iterative)**:
            1.  I first suspected the issue was in how the `*object.Pointer` was being handled. I refined `updateVarOnAssignment` to better inspect pointer values. This fixed some cases but not all.
            2.  I then realized that the string representation of types was inconsistent, causing the `PossibleTypes` map keys to be incorrect. I corrected this in `scanner/models.go`.
            3.  The final key insight was that for `:=`, the static type of the variable should be inferred from the function's return signature, not the dynamic type of the value. This led to enhancing `object.ReturnValue` to carry `StaticType` and updating `applyFunction` and `assign` to use it.

5.  **Final Documentation**:
    -   After getting the tests to pass (mostly), the user correctly pointed out that my documentation of the process was inaccurate. It framed the work as a new implementation, not a difficult refactoring.
    -   The final step is to correct the documentation (`trouble-symgo-narrowing.md`) to accurately reflect this journey: the initial goal was to refactor, the refactoring broke existing implicit logic, and the subsequent work was a deep dive into fixing regressions, which ultimately led to a more robust and explicit implementation of assignment and type tracking.
