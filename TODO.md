## Implemented

-   **AST-based Parsing:** Core functionality using `go/parser` and `go/ast`.
-   **Cross-Package Type Resolution:** Lazy resolution of type definitions within the same module (`FieldType.Resolve()`, `PackageResolver` interface).
-   **Recursive Type and Dependency Handling**: Gracefully handles recursive type definitions and circular dependencies between packages, preventing infinite loops during type resolution.
-   **Type Definition Extraction:**
    -   Structs (fields, tags, embedded structs): `StructInfo`, `FieldInfo`.
    -   Complex types (pointers, slices, maps): `FieldType` properties (`IsPointer`, `IsSlice`, `IsMap`, `Elem`, `MapKey`).
    -   Type aliases and underlying types: `TypeInfo.Kind == AliasKind`, `TypeInfo.Underlying`.
    -   Function type declarations: `TypeInfo.Kind == FuncKind`, `TypeInfo.Func`.
    -   Interface types: `TypeInfo.Kind == InterfaceKind`, `TypeInfo.Interface`, `InterfaceInfo`, `MethodInfo`.
-   **Constant Extraction:** Top-level `const` declarations (`ConstantInfo`).
-   **Function/Method Signature Extraction:** Top-level functions and methods (`FunctionInfo`, including receiver).
-   **Documentation Parsing:** GoDoc comments for types, fields, functions, constants (`TypeInfo.Doc`, `FieldInfo.Doc`, etc.).
-   **Package Locator:** Module root finding and import path resolution (`locator.Locator`).
-   **External and Standard Library Package Resolution**: Added an option (`WithGoModuleResolver`) to enable resolving packages from the Go standard library (`GOROOT`) and external dependencies listed in `go.mod` (from `GOMODCACHE`). This allows the scanner to "see" types outside the main module without relying on `go/packages`.
-   **External Type Overrides:** Mechanism to treat specified external types as other Go types (`Scanner.ExternalTypeOverrides`, `FieldType.IsResolvedByConfig`).
-   **Basic Generic Type Parsing:**
    -   Type parameters for types and functions: `TypeInfo.TypeParams`, `FunctionInfo.TypeParams`, `TypeParamInfo`.
    -   Type arguments for instantiated generic types: `FieldType.TypeArgs`.
-   **AST Access:** `PackageInfo.AstFiles`, `PackageInfo.Fset`, `TypeInfo.Node`, `FunctionInfo.AstDecl`.
-   **File Generation Helpers:** `goscan.GoFile`, `goscan.PackageDirectory`, `SaveGoFile`.
-   **Import Management:** `goscan.ImportManager` for generated code.
-   **Basic Interface Implementation Check:** `goscan.Implements` (structs implementing interfaces).
-   **AST Iteration Utilities:** `astwalk.ToplevelStructs`.
-   **Improved Scanning Logic in Example Tools:** Command-line tools in `examples/` now handle file and directory paths more intelligently, distinguishing between them and grouping file arguments by package. This was implemented as described in [docs/plan-scan-improvement.md](./docs/plan-scan-improvement.md).
-   **Testing Harness (`scantest`):** Implemented the `scantest` library to provide a testing harness for `go-scan` based tools. The implementation, detailed in [docs/plan-scantest.md](./docs/plan-scantest.md), uses a significant enhancement not in the original plan: I/O operations are intercepted via `context.Context`. This allows `scantest` to capture file generation output in memory without altering the tool's own code, a key difference from initial concepts.
-   **In-Memory File Overlay:** Added an "overlay" feature to `go-scan` to allow providing in-memory file content. This is useful for tools that generate or modify Go source code without writing to the filesystem. This was implemented as described in [docs/plan-overlay.md](./docs/plan-overlay.md).
-   **Integration Tests for Examples:** Added integration tests for the code generation tools in the `examples/` directory using the new `scantest` library.
-   **Variadic Parameter Parsing**: Correctly parses variadic parameters (e.g., `...string`) as slice types (e.g., `[]string`) within function signatures. The `IsVariadic` flag on `FunctionInfo` is set, and the parameter's `FieldType` accurately reflects the corresponding slice type.
-   **Initial `convert` Tool Implementation**: Implemented the CLI entrypoint and a basic parser for the `convert` tool. The tool now uses a `@derivingconvert(DstType)` annotation on source types to define conversion pairs, as documented in the updated `docs/plan-neo-convert.md`.
-   **Improved Import Management**: Handle import alias collisions robustly. By pre-registering types with the `ImportManager` and.

    -   [x] **Add Tests for Slice Fields**: Write tests for slice field conversions.
    -   [x] **Generator for Map Fields**: Extend the generator to handle map fields (e.g., `map[string]SrcType` to `map[string]DstType`).
    -   [x] **Add Tests for Map Fields**: Write tests for map field conversions.
    -   [x] **Map Element Conversion**: The generator now produces recursive helper function calls for elements within maps, supporting maps of structs.
    -   [x] **Implement `convert:` Tag Handling**:
        -   [x] `convert:"-"`: Skip a field.
        -   [x] `convert:"NewName"`: Map to a different field name.
        -   [x] `convert:",using=myFunc"`: Use a custom conversion function.
        -   [x] `convert:",required"`: Report an error if a pointer field is nil.

        -   [x] Update the parser to recognize and process the `// convert:import` annotation.
        -   [x] Ensure the parser registers the specified alias and path with the `ImportManager`.
        -   [x] Modify the `using` and `validator` logic to correctly resolve function references that use these imported aliases (e.g., `pkg.MyFunc`).
-   **Fix for Standard Library Scanning in Tests**: Resolved the `mismatched package names` error that occurred when scanning standard library packages (like `time`) from within a test binary. This was achieved by enhancing the `ExternalTypeOverride` mechanism to accept synthetic `scanner.TypeInfo` objects, allowing tools to bypass problematic scans without hardcoding workarounds in their parsers.
-   **On-Demand, Multi-Package AST Scanning**: All features based on the plan in [docs/plan-multi-package-handling.md](./docs/plan-multi-package-handling.md) have been implemented, including core library logic, consumer updates, and CI checks.
-   **Generator Logic Enhancements**:
    -   **Recursive Converter Generation**: The generator now automatically creates converters for nested struct types.
    -   **Pointer-Aware Global Rules**: Global conversion rules now correctly apply to pointer types (e.g., a rule for `T` -> `S` also works for `*T` -> `*S`).
    -   **Improved Type Resolution for Generics/Pointers**: The core scanner now correctly populates the `Elem` and `TypeArgs` fields for pointer types, resolving previous inconsistencies.
-   **CLI and Build**:
    -   Fixed the underlying scanner and generator bugs that caused the `make e2e` command to fail.
    -   The `go install` command in the `e2e` target has been updated to `go build`.
    -   The main `test` target now incorporates the `e2e` tests.
-   **Enum-like Constant Scanning**: Implemented scanning for idiomatic Go enums (a custom type with a group of related constants). This includes package-level discovery and linking constants to their type, and it correctly handles `iota`. The feature is detailed in [docs/plan-scan-enum.md](./docs/plan-scan-enum.md).
    -   [x] Modify `scanner/models.go` to support enum members.
    -   [x] Implement Package-Level Discovery for enums.
    -   [x] Implement Lazy Symbol-Based Lookup for enums (via the existing package resolver).
    -   [x] Add Tests for Both Enum Scanning Strategies.
-   **Unified Single-Pass Generator**: Combined the `derivingjson` and `derivingbind` tools into a single, efficient `deriving-all` command. This tool parses source files only once and uses refactored, composable generator functions to produce the combined output. The implementation followed the plan in [docs/plan-walk-once.md](./docs/plan-walk-once.md).
    -   [x] Refactored `derivingjson` and `derivingbind` to separate generation logic from file I/O.
    -   [x] Implemented the `deriving-all` orchestrator tool.
    -   [x] Added integration tests for the unified tool using `scantest`.
-   **`derivingjson` Tool**:
    -   [x] `UnmarshalJSON` generation for `oneOf` style interfaces using `@deriving:unmarshal`.
    -   [x] `MarshalJSON` generation for `oneOf` concrete types using `@deriving:marshal` to add a type discriminator.
-   **In-Module Dependency Walker (`go-scan` Library Core)**: Implemented the core library features for dependency walking as described in [docs/plan-in-module-deps-walk.md](./docs/plan-in-module-deps-walk.md).
    -   [x] **Lightweight "Imports-Only" Scanning Mode**: Added `ScanPackageImports` for efficient dependency discovery without a full AST parse.
    -   [x] **Generic Graph Traversal Utility**: Added the `Walk` method and `Visitor` interface to allow for flexible dependency graph traversal.
    -   [x] **Unit Tests**: Added comprehensive unit tests for the new scanning and walking features.
-   **`deps-walk` Command-Line Tool**: Implemented the `deps-walk` tool as described in [docs/plan-in-module-deps-walk.md](./docs/plan-in-module-deps-walk.md).
    -   [x] **Initial Tool Setup**: Created the basic CLI structure for the `deps-walk` tool and implemented the logic to call the `goscan.Scanner.Walk` method.
    -   [x] **Core Visualization Features**: Implemented graph generation in DOT format and added support for the `--hops` flag to limit traversal depth.
    -   [x] **Multiple Output Formats**: Added support for Mermaid as an output format alongside DOT via the `--format` flag.
    -   [x] **Filtering and Usability**: Added support for the `--ignore` flag for package exclusion and a `--full` flag to include external dependencies (defaulting to in-module only). Also added a `--hide` flag to hide packages from the output without affecting traversal.
    -   [x] **Integration Tests**: Added integration tests for the `deps-walk` tool using `scantest`.
    -   [x] **Reverse Dependency Search**: Added a `--direction=reverse` option to find and visualize reverse dependencies (importers). This is supported by a new `goscan.FindImporters` method that efficiently scans the module for import statements.
    -   [x] **Bidirectional Dependency Graph**: Added a `--direction=bidi` option to show both forward dependencies (up to `--hops`) and reverse dependencies (importers) in the same graph.
    -   [x] **Hop Count Limiting for Reverse Searches**: The `--hops` flag is now correctly applied to reverse dependency searches, in addition to forward searches.
-   **Refactoring**:
    -   [x] **Isolate `examples/deps-walk` Test Data**: Moved the test data for the `deps-walk` example from the root `testdata` directory to its own `examples/deps-walk/testdata` directory, making the example more self-contained.
    -   [x] **Centralize Path Resolution**: Moved the logic for resolving relative file paths to Go package paths from the `deps-walk` example into the core `locator` package (`locator.ResolvePkgPath`). This makes the functionality reusable for other tools.
-   **Debuggability and Testing**:
    -   [x] **Inspect and Dry-Run Modes**:
        -   [x] **Inspect Mode**: Implemented an `--inspect` flag and corresponding `WithInspect()` option to provide detailed structured logging (`slog`) of the annotation detection process. This helps in debugging why a type is or isn't being processed.
        -   [x] **Dry-Run Mode**: Implemented a `--dry-run` flag and `WithDryRun()` option that prevents file generation, allowing users to preview the output without writing to disk.
        -   [x] **CLI Tool Integration**: Added the `--inspect` and `--dry-run` flags to the following tools:
            -   [x] `examples/derivingjson`
            -   [x] `examples/derivingbind`
            -   [x] `examples/convert`
            -   [x] `examples/deriving-all`
            -   [x] `examples/deps-walk`
        -   [x] **Integration Tests**: Added tests using the `scantest` library to verify the functionality of the new inspect and dry-run modes.
        -   [x] **`resolution_path` Logging**: Implement the `resolution_path` field in structured logs to trace how a type was resolved.
