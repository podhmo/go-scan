# Trouble: State Propagation in `symgo` for `docgen`

## Context
The task is to extend the `docgen` tool's custom pattern system to support path and query parameters. The core logic for this feature has been implemented in `patterns.go` and `loader.go`.

## Problem
A persistent testing issue is blocking the completion of this feature. An integration test was created by adding a new handler and a custom pattern to the existing `custom-patterns` test case. The test consistently fails with a diff error, indicating that the OpenAPI specification generated by the `docgen` tool does not match the golden file.

Specifically, the `parameters` and `responses` sections for the new endpoint are missing from the generated output.

This suggests that while the custom pattern for `GetPetID` is being correctly identified and its corresponding intrinsic (`HandleCustomParameter`) is called, the modifications made to the `openapi.Operation` object within that intrinsic are being lost. Similarly, the `w.Write` call in the handler, which should be handled by a default pattern, is also not being reflected in the output.

## Analysis
This strongly points to a state propagation problem within the `symgo` symbolic execution engine, specifically concerning how the `docgen.Analyzer` manages the `openapi.Operation` object during the analysis of a handler function.

The `analyzeHandleFunc` function creates a new `*openapi.Operation` object. It then passes this object to `analyzeHandlerBody`, which pushes it onto a stack (`operationStack`). The intrinsics (both default and custom) fetch the operation object from the top of this stack and modify it.

Despite attempts to ensure the modified object is correctly returned and assigned (by changing `analyzeHandlerBody` to return the `*openapi.Operation`), the changes are still lost. This indicates that the `op` object being modified by the intrinsics is not the same instance as the one that is ultimately assigned to the final `openapi.PathItem` in `analyzeHandleFunc`.

This issue is a recurrence of a previously fixed bug mentioned in `TODO.md` ("a state propagation problem where side effects on the openapi.Operation object were lost"). The previous fix was likely incomplete and did not cover all execution paths.

## Next Steps
Further investigation is needed into the `symgo.Interpreter` and `docgen.Analyzer` to understand how state is managed across intrinsic calls within a single handler analysis. The problem likely lies in how scopes or the analyzer context are handled during the `interpreter.Apply` call within `analyzeHandlerBody`.

A minimal reproduction case focusing solely on an intrinsic modifying a shared object passed through the context would be beneficial for debugging the `symgo` engine itself.
