# Trouble Report: `goinspect` Fails on Its Own Codebase

This document details an issue where the `examples/goinspect` tool failed to analyze its own source code, and the steps taken to resolve it.

## Symptom

When running `goinspect` on its own package, the tool would terminate with an error from the underlying `symgo` symbolic execution engine.

**Commands to Reproduce:**

```bash
( cd ./examples/goinspect && GOBIN=/tmp go install -v . )
/tmp/goinspect --trim-prefix --pkg .
```

**Error Log:**

The `symgo` evaluator would produce an error similar to the following (actual error message varied depending on the exact code state, but the nature was consistent):

```
symgo runtime error: identifier not found: PackageDirectory
    at path/to/goinspect/main.go:XX:XX
    in NewPackageDirectory
```

This indicated that when `symgo` was symbolically executing a function (e.g., `NewPackageDirectory`), it could not find the definition for a type (`PackageDirectory`) that was defined in the same package.

## Root Cause Analysis

The investigation revealed a fundamental flaw in how the `symgo` evaluator managed scope. When `Eval()` was called on a function, the environment (`env`) did not contain all the necessary package-level declarations, specifically type definitions. The evaluator would only load functions and constants, but not the `type` declarations from the package.

This led to a cascading failure:
1.  A composite literal like `PackageDirectory{...}` would be evaluated.
2.  The evaluator would try to resolve the type `PackageDirectory` in the current environment.
3.  Since type declarations were not loaded into the package's environment, the lookup failed.
4.  The evaluator correctly reported an "identifier not found" error.

A secondary, related issue was discovered during the fix: the `object.Struct` type, necessary for representing struct instances, was missing from the `symgo/object` package, likely due to an accidental deletion.

## Resolution

A multi-part fix was implemented in the `symgo/evaluator` and `symgo/object` packages:

1.  **Reinstated `object.Struct`**: The `object.Struct` type was re-added to `symgo/object/object.go`.
2.  **Populate Type Definitions**: The `ensurePackageEnvPopulated` function in `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go` was modified to iterate over `pkgInfo.Types` and add them to the package's environment (`pkgObj.Env`). This ensures that all type definitions are available before any function in that package is evaluated.
3.  **Refined Struct Literal Evaluation**: `evalCompositeLit` was updated to create a new `*object.Instance` that wraps an underlying `*object.Struct`. This provides the detailed field information needed for struct-specific operations while maintaining compatibility with the rest of the evaluator, which expects `*object.Instance` for method calls.
4.  **Updated Field/Method Access**: `evalSelectorExpr` was modified to check if an `*object.Instance` has an underlying `*object.Struct` and, if so, to attempt direct field access on it before falling back to method resolution.

These changes collectively ensure that package-level scope is correctly established and that struct literals are evaluated into a rich object representation that supports both field access and method calls, resolving the original bug.
