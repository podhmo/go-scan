### 1. Initial Prompt

The user requested a fix for a bug in the `symgo` tool where the analysis would fail on Go code containing embedded interfaces. The error reported was `undefined method "Pos" on interface "Expr"`. The user pointed to an item in `TODO.md` related to this issue and asked for the fix to be implemented and a test case to be added.

### 2. Goal

The primary objective is to fix the Go code scanner (`scanner/scanner.go`) so that it correctly parses interfaces that contain embedded interfaces, especially when those interfaces are defined in different packages. The fix should ensure that the method set of the parent interface includes all methods from the embedded interfaces. A new test case must be added to verify this functionality.

### 3. Initial Implementation Attempt

My first approach was to modify the `parseInterfaceType` function in `scanner/scanner.go`. I identified the `else` block that handles non-method fields (i.e., embedded types) as the area that needed changes. The initial logic was to:
1.  Resolve the `TypeInfo` of the embedded type.
2.  Check if the resolved type was an interface.
3.  If it was, append the methods from the embedded interface's `TypeInfo` to the parent interface's method list.

For verification, I started writing a new test, `TestInterfaceEmbedding`, in `scanner/scanner_test.go`. My first attempt to create the required multi-package test setup involved manually creating an in-memory file overlay.

### 4. Roadblocks & Key Discoveries

The initial path had several issues that led to key discoveries about the codebase:

*   **Brittle Manual Test Setup:** The manual file overlay I created for the test was incorrect. It contained invalid Go code (using `a.Reader` instead of the correct `pkg_a.Reader`), which caused the test to fail for reasons unrelated to the actual bug. This led to the discovery that the project has a dedicated testing utility, `scantest`, designed for this exact purpose.

*   **Test-Induced Import Cycle:** After refactoring the test to use `scantest`, I encountered a build failure due to an import cycle: `scanner_test.go` (in package `scanner`) was importing `scantest`, which in turn imported `scanner`. This revealed a structural requirement for testing: when a test needs to import a helper package that itself depends on the package under test, the test must be placed in an external test package (e.g., `package scanner_test`).

*   **API Misunderstandings:** I made several incorrect assumptions about the `scantest` and `locator` APIs, leading to further build errors. This highlighted the importance of using the high-level `scantest.Run` function, which correctly wires up the entire scanning environment, rather than trying to construct it manually.

*   **Shallow Logic Flaw:** The most significant roadblock was the final test failure: `expected interface to have method 'Read' from embedded interface, but found: [Close]`. This error message was crucial. It proved that my test setup was finally correct and that the scanner was correctly parsing locally-defined methods (`Close`), but my core fix was still flawed. It was not inheriting the methods from the embedded type (`Read`). This led to the discovery that my logic did not account for type aliases. An embedded type might not be an interface directly but an alias to one, and my code needed to resolve these aliases transitively.

### 5. Major Refactoring Effort

Based on these discoveries, the solution was significantly refactored:

1.  **Test Code:** The test `TestInterfaceEmbedding` was moved out of `scanner_test.go` and into its own file, `scanner_embedding_test.go`, with the package declared as `package scanner_test` to break the import cycle. The test was rewritten to use `scantest.WriteFiles` and `scantest.Run`, the intended testing pattern for this project.

2.  **Production Code:** The implementation in `parseInterfaceType` (`scanner/scanner.go`) was made more robust. The final version includes a `for` loop that repeatedly resolves the `Underlying` type of an embedded field. This allows the scanner to handle any number of nested type aliases, ensuring it finds the base interface and can correctly inherit its methods.

### 6. Current Status

The codebase is in a near-complete state but is still failing. The production code in `scanner.go` contains the improved, alias-aware logic for parsing embedded interfaces. The test harness in `scanner_embedding_test.go` is correctly structured.

However, the last test run still fails with the error: `action: expected interface to have method 'Read' from embedded interface, but found: [Close]`.

This indicates that even with the alias-resolution logic, the methods from the embedded interface are not being correctly appended to the parent interface's method set. The bug is very subtle and located within the `parseInterfaceType` function.

### 7. References

*   `docs/prompts.md`: Contains instructions for how to structure this document.
*   `scantest/scantest.go`: Understanding the `Run` and `WriteFiles` functions in this file is critical for writing correct tests for the scanner.

### 8. TODO / Next Steps

1.  **Debug `parseInterfaceType`:** The immediate next step is to debug the logic within the `else` block of the `for` loop in the `parseInterfaceType` function in `scanner/scanner.go`.
2.  **Verify Resolution Result:** Confirm what `embeddedFieldType.Resolve(ctx)` is returning. It is likely returning a `TypeInfo` for `pkg_a.Reader`, but the `Interface.Methods` slice within it is empty. The question is *why* it's empty.
3.  **Trace the `pkg_a` Scan:** Investigate the lifecycle of the scan for `pkg_a`. It gets triggered "on-demand" by the resolver. It's possible that the `TypeInfo` for `Reader` is created and cached before its own methods have been parsed, and the stale, empty version is being returned. This suggests a potential caching or state-ordering issue within the scanner itself.
4.  **Confirm the Fix:** Once the underlying issue is found and fixed, run `go test ./...` to ensure that `TestInterfaceEmbedding` and all other tests pass.
