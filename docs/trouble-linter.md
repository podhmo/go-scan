# Linter Warning vs. Potential Nil Pointer Dereference

## The Problem
The `staticcheck` linter (specifically rule `S1031`) suggests removing `nil` checks before `for...range` loops over slices. In `scanner/scanner.go`, in the function `parseFuncType`, there are checks like this:

```go
if ft.Params != nil {
    for _, p := range ft.Params.List {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Here, `ft.Params` is of type `*ast.FieldList`. If `ft.Params` is `nil`, the expression `ft.Params.List` would cause a panic. While ranging over a `nil` slice is safe, accessing a field on a `nil` pointer is not.

The linter's advice implies that `ft.Params` is guaranteed by the Go parser to never be `nil`, even if a function has no parameters. It would likely be a pointer to an empty `ast.FieldList` struct.

## Decision
Given the uncertainty, and to avoid introducing a potential panic, I am deferring the removal of these `nil` checks. I will record this issue here and proceed with fixing other, more straightforward lint errors. This issue can be revisited if more information about the Go parser's guarantees becomes available.
