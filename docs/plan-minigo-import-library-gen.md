# Plan: Generating Minigo Bindings for Go Libraries

This document outlines a strategy for deeply integrating existing Go libraries with the minigo interpreter. The primary goal is to allow minigo scripts to seamlessly import and use functions and variables from standard or third-party Go packages, such as `strings`, `bytes`, or even more complex ones like `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`.

We will cover three main topics:
1.  **The Current Manual Binding System**: How to expose Go code to minigo today.
2.  **A Proposal for Automated Generation**: A plan to create a tool that automatically generates the necessary binding code for any given Go package.
3.  **Concurrency Considerations**: An analysis of how Go's concurrency features, particularly goroutines, can be safely and effectively used from within minigo.

## 1. Manual Binding with `Interpreter.Register`

The minigo interpreter already provides a mechanism for exposing Go functions and variables to scripts: the `Interpreter.Register` method. This method allows you to register a collection of symbols under a specific package path.

### How It Works

The `Register` method has the following signature:

```go
func (i *Interpreter) Register(pkgPath string, symbols map[string]any)
```

-   `pkgPath`: The path that will be used in the minigo `import` statement (e.g., `"strings"`).
-   `symbols`: A map where keys are the symbol names (e.g., `"ToUpper"`) and values are the actual Go functions or variables (e.g., `strings.ToUpper`).

When a minigo script executes `import "strings"`, the interpreter makes the registered symbols available. The evaluator's interop layer handles the complex work of:
-   Converting minigo arguments to the required Go types for function calls.
-   Calling the Go function using reflection.
-   Converting the Go function's return values back into minigo objects.

### Example: Manually Binding the `strings` Package

Here is how you would manually expose a few functions from the standard `strings` package to a minigo script:

**Go Code:**

```go
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "strings"

    "github.com/podhmo/go-scan/minigo"
)

func main() {
    // 1. Create a new interpreter instance.
    interp, err := minigo.NewInterpreter()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create interpreter: %v", err)
    }

    // 2. Register the desired functions from the "strings" package.
    interp.Register("strings", map[string]any{
        "ToUpper":   strings.ToUpper,
        "ToLower":   strings.ToLower,
        "HasPrefix": strings.HasPrefix,
        "TrimSpace": strings.TrimSpace,
    })

    // 3. The minigo script to be executed.
    script := `
package main

import "strings"

var greeting = "  Hello, World!  "
var upper_greeting = strings.ToUpper(greeting)
var trimmed_greeting = strings.TrimSpace(greeting)
var has_prefix = strings.HasPrefix(trimmed_greeting, "Hello")
`

    // 4. Load and evaluate the script.
    if err := interp.LoadFile("myscript.mgo", []byte(script)); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to load script: %v", err)
    }
    if _, err := interp.Eval(context.Background()); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to evaluate script: %v", err)
    }

    // 5. Inspect the results.
    env := interp.GlobalEnvForTest()
    fmt.Println(env.Get("upper_greeting"))   // "  HELLO, WORLD!  "
    fmt.Println(env.Get("trimmed_greeting")) // "Hello, World!"
    fmt.Println(env.Get("has_prefix"))       // true
}
```

This approach is powerful and works well for exposing a small, curated set of functions. However, it is not scalable. Manually binding every function in a large package like `strings` would be tedious and error-prone. This limitation leads us to the need for an automated solution.

## 2. Proposal: Automated Binding Generation

To solve the scalability problem, we propose the creation of a command-line tool, tentatively named `minigo-gen-bindings`. This tool will inspect a Go package and automatically generate a new, small Go package containing an `Install` function. This function, when called, will register all of the target package's exported symbols with the minigo interpreter.

This approach provides a more granular and idiomatic way to manage bindings, allowing users to import and install support for standard libraries on demand.

### Tool Workflow

The `minigo-gen-bindings` tool would operate as follows:

1.  **Input**: The tool would accept a Go package import path and an output directory.
    ```sh
    go run ./tools/minigo-gen-bindings --pkg "strings" --output "minigo/stdlib"
    ```

2.  **Package Location**: It will use the `go/build` package to locate the source code for the target package. `build.Import("strings", "", build.FindOnly)` would provide the directory path of the "strings" package.

3.  **AST Parsing**: The tool will then parse all the `.go` files in that directory using `go/parser`. This creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for each file.

4.  **Exported Symbol Discovery**: It will walk the AST of each file to find all exported top-level declarations (functions, variables, and constants).

5.  **Code Generation**: Finally, the tool will generate a new Go package inside the specified output directory. For the `strings` package, this would create `minigo/stdlib/strings/install.go`. This file will contain the `Install` function.

### Example: Generated `Install` Package

Running the tool for the `strings` package would produce the following directory structure and file:

**Directory Structure:**
```
minigo/
└── stdlib/
    └── strings/
        └── install.go
```

**Generated File Content (`minigo/stdlib/strings/install.go`):**
```go
// Code generated by minigo-gen-bindings. DO NOT EDIT.

package strings

import (
	"strings"
	"github.com/podhmo/go-scan/minigo"
)

// Install binds all exported symbols from the "strings" package to the interpreter.
func Install(interp *minigo.Interpreter) {
	interp.Register("strings", map[string]any{
		"Clone":         strings.Clone,
		"Compare":       strings.Compare,
		"Contains":      strings.Contains,
		"ContainsAny":   strings.ContainsAny,
		"ContainsRune":  strings.ContainsRune,
		"Count":         strings.Count,
		"Cut":           strings.Cut,
		"CutPrefix":     strings.CutPrefix,
		"CutSuffix":     strings.CutSuffix,
		"EqualFold":     strings.EqualFold,
		"Fields":        strings.Fields,
		"FieldsFunc":    strings.FieldsFunc,
		"HasPrefix":     strings.HasPrefix,
		"HasSuffix":     strings.HasSuffix,
		"Index":         strings.Index,
		"IndexAny":      strings.IndexAny,
		"IndexByte":     strings.IndexByte,
		"IndexFunc":     strings.IndexFunc,
		"IndexRune":     strings.IndexRune,
		"Join":          strings.Join,
		"LastIndex":     strings.LastIndex,
		"LastIndexAny":  strings.LastIndexAny,
		"LastIndexByte": strings.LastIndexByte,
		"LastIndexFunc": strings.LastIndexFunc,
		"Map":           strings.Map,
		"Repeat":        strings.Repeat,
		"Replace":       strings.Replace,
		"ReplaceAll":    strings.ReplaceAll,
		"Split":         strings.Split,
		"SplitAfter":    strings.SplitAfter,
		"SplitAfterN":   strings.SplitAfterN,
		"SplitN":        strings.SplitN,
		"ToLower":       strings.ToLower,
		"ToLowerSpecial": strings.ToLowerSpecial,
		"ToTitle":       strings.ToTitle,
		"ToTitleSpecial": strings.ToTitleSpecial,
		"ToUpper":       strings.ToUpper,
		"ToUpperSpecial": strings.ToUpperSpecial,
		"ToValidUTF8":   strings.ToValidUTF8,
		"Trim":          strings.Trim,
		"TrimFunc":      strings.TrimFunc,
		"TrimLeft":      strings.TrimLeft,
		"TrimLeftFunc":  strings.TrimLeftFunc,
		"TrimPrefix":    strings.TrimPrefix,
		"TrimRight":     strings.TrimRight,
		"TrimRightFunc": strings.TrimRightFunc,
		"TrimSpace":     strings.TrimSpace,
		"TrimSuffix":    strings.TrimSuffix,
		// Note: Exported variables and constants would also be included here.
	})
}
```

### Usage

The user can then import the generated package and call its `Install` function to make the entire `strings` package available to minigo scripts.

```go
import (
    "github.com/podhmo/go-scan/minigo"
    stdlib_strings "github.com/podhmo/go-scan/minigo/stdlib/strings"
)

func main() {
    interp, _ := minigo.NewInterpreter()

    // Install the 'strings' package bindings.
    stdlib_strings.Install(interp)

    // Now minigo scripts running on this interpreter can `import "strings"`.
}
```

This approach is robust, automated, and provides a clean, modular way to extend the minigo standard library.

## Implementation Task List

To implement the proposed feature, we will first build the core logic into the `go-scan` library itself, then build the generator tool on top of it. This makes the symbol extraction logic reusable for other purposes, such as REPL autocompletion or documentation tools.

1.  **Core Function: List Exported Symbols:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a new public function in the `go-scan` library, e.g., `goscan.ListExportedSymbols(pkgPath string) ([]string, error)`, to extract all exported symbol names from a given package.
    *   **Implementation Strategy:** Two versions of this function should be considered.
        *   **Primary (go-scan native):** This version will use `go-scan`'s own `Scanner` to locate and parse the files for the target package. This is the preferred "dog-fooding" approach, as it aligns with `go-scan`'s philosophy of avoiding the eager loading of dependency information that `go/build` can cause. This ensures the tool remains lightweight and focused.
        *   **Fallback (`go/build` based):** A simpler version that uses `go/build.Import()` to locate the package files. This can serve as a straightforward initial implementation or an "emergency hatch" if the native scanning approach proves too complex at first. The primary long-term goal is to rely on the `go-scan` native implementation.
    *   **Testing:** Add a unit test for this function. The test should be able to validate either implementation by running against a standard library package (e.g., `strings`) and asserting that the returned list of symbols is correct.

2.  **Build the Generator Tool:**
    *   **Goal:** Create the `minigo-gen-bindings` command-line tool.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Create the command skeleton in `tools/minigo-gen-bindings/main.go` with `--pkg` and `--output` flags.
        2.  Call the `goscan.ListExportedSymbols()` function created in the previous step to get the list of symbols for the given `--pkg`.
        3.  Use a `text/template` to generate the `install.go` file content.
        4.  Create the output directory (e.g., `minigo/stdlib/strings`) and write the generated file.

3.  **Generate and Test Standard Library Bindings:**
    *   **Goal:** Use the new tool to generate bindings and verify they work.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Run the generator for `strings` and `fmt`.
            ```sh
            go run ./tools/minigo-gen-bindings --pkg "strings" --output "minigo/stdlib"
            go run ./tools/minigo-gen-bindings --pkg "fmt" --output "minigo/stdlib"
            ```
        2.  Create an integration test (`minigo/minigo_stdlib_test.go`) that imports these new packages, calls their `Install()` functions on an interpreter instance, and successfully runs a minigo script that uses functions from both `strings` and `fmt`.

### Future Goal: Dog-fooding the Generator

A long-term objective is to "dog-food" this entire process. Once the `go-scan` library is sufficiently powerful and exposed to minigo through these generated bindings, it should be possible to write a new version of the `minigo-gen-bindings` script *in minigo itself*. This would be a powerful demonstration of the minigo ecosystem's capabilities and a testament to its practical utility.

## 3. Concurrency and Goroutines

A key question is whether minigo can interact with Go's powerful concurrency features. For example, can it use packages like `sync` or `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`? The answer is yes, with some important clarifications.

### The Execution Model

From the perspective of a minigo script, execution is **synchronous and single-threaded**. A minigo script does not have its own `go` keyword or a way to manage goroutines directly. It executes statements one after another.

When a minigo script calls a Go function (that has been bound via `Register`), the interpreter blocks and waits for the Go function to return. This is the same behavior as a standard function call in Go.

### Using Goroutines Within a Bound Go Function

The crucial point is that the bound Go function is a normal Go function. It can do anything a Go function can do, including creating and managing goroutines. The minigo interpreter is unaware of this internal concurrency; it only sees a single function call that takes some time to complete.

This means that packages like `errgroup` are perfectly safe and effective to use.

### Example: A Concurrent Fetcher

Imagine we want to fetch multiple web pages concurrently and return their titles. We could write a Go function that uses an `errgroup` for this purpose and expose it to minigo.

**Go Code:**

```go
import (
    "context"
    "io"
    "net/http"
    "strings"

    "golang.org/x/sync/errgroup"
    "github.com/podhmo/go-scan/minigo"
)

// fetchTitle is a helper that fetches a single URL and extracts its title.
func fetchTitle(ctx context.Context, url string) (string, error) {
    req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", url, nil)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    body, err := io.ReadAll(io.LimitReader(resp.Body, 100*1024)) // Limit read size
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    // Simple/naive title extraction
    s := string(body)
    start := strings.Index(s, "<title>")
    if start == -1 {
        return "No title found", nil
    }
    start += len("<title>")
    end := strings.Index(s[start:], "</title>")
    if end == -1 {
        return "No title found", nil
    }
    return s[start : start+end], nil
}

// FetchAllTitles uses an errgroup to fetch titles concurrently.
// This is the function we will expose to minigo.
func FetchAllTitles(urls []string) ([]string, error) {
    g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())
    titles := make([]string, len(urls))

    for i, url := range urls {
        i, url := i, url // https://golang.org/doc/faq#closures_and_goroutines
        g.Go(func() error {
            title, err := fetchTitle(ctx, url)
            if err == nil {
                titles[i] = title
            }
            return err
        })
    }

    if err := g.Wait(); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return titles, nil
}

// Now, let's register it and call it from minigo.
func run() {
    interp, _ := minigo.NewInterpreter()
    interp.Register("web", map[string]any{
        "FetchAllTitles": FetchAllTitles,
    })

    script := `
package main
import "web"

// Note: minigo doesn't have a native string slice literal,
// so we'd need to pass it in or have another way to construct it.
// For this example, assume we can construct the slice.
var urls = ["https://golang.org", "https://github.com"]
var titles, err = web.FetchAllTitles(urls)
`
    // ... load and eval script ...
}
```

In this example, the minigo script calls `web.FetchAllTitles`. The interpreter freezes while the Go function executes. Internally, `FetchAllTitles` fans out multiple goroutines. When all goroutines are finished, `g.Wait()` returns, `FetchAllTitles` returns its result, and the minigo interpreter continues, populating the `titles` and `err` variables.

The concurrency is entirely encapsulated within the Go function, which is a clean and safe way to leverage Go's power from a simple scripting environment. The same logic applies to using lower-level primitives from the `sync` package like `sync.Mutex` or `sync.WaitGroup`. They will work as expected within the Go function's context.

## 4. Conclusion

The minigo interpreter provides a solid foundation for Go interoperability via the `Interpreter.Register` method. While manual binding is effective for small-scale integrations, it does not scale to entire libraries.

The proposed `minigo-gen-bindings` tool addresses this challenge directly. By automatically scanning a Go package and generating the necessary binding code, it offers a path to seamlessly integrate any Go library with minigo. This approach provides:

-   **Automation**: Eliminates the tedious and error-prone task of writing manual bindings.
-   **Completeness**: Ensures that all exported functions and variables of a package are made available.
-   **Safety**: The generated code is type-safe at the Go level, while the interop layer already handles the dynamic nature of the scripting environment.
-   **Power**: Unlocks the full potential of the Go ecosystem for minigo scripts, including powerful concurrency patterns.

By implementing this generator, minigo can evolve into a more powerful and versatile scripting environment, deeply integrated with Go.
