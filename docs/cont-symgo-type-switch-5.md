# Continuation of Sym-Go Type Switch Implementation (5)

## Initial Prompt

(Translated from Japanese)
"Please read one task from TODO.md and implement it. If necessary, break it down into sub-tasks. After breaking it down, you can write it in TODO.md. Then, please proceed with the work. Keep modifying the code until the tests pass. After finishing the work, please be sure to update TODO.md at the end. The task to choose should be a symgo task. The origin is docs/plan-symgo-type-switch.md, and you can see the overall progress here. The implementation itself is a continuation of docs/cont-symgo-type-switch-4.md. Please do your best to modify the code so that the test code passes. Once it is somewhat complete, please also pay attention to the behavior inside and outside the policy. Please especially address the parts that are in progress. If you cannot complete it, please add it to TODO.md."

## Goal

The primary objective is to fix the remaining test failures related to the `symgo-type-switch` feature, which includes `TestInterfaceBinding`. This requires correctly implementing the logic for dispatching calls from interface methods to concrete methods, especially when intrinsics are registered on the concrete methods.

## Initial Implementation Attempt

My initial work involved fixing a series of cascading build errors caused by a previous refactoring of the `applyFunction` call stack in `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go`. After fixing these build errors, I focused on the `TestInterfaceBinding` failure.

My first hypothesis was that the logic for dispatching the interface call to the concrete type's intrinsic was missing. I added logic to `applyFunctionImpl` to check for an intrinsic on the concrete type when a binding was found. This did not work, and my attempts to debug using logging were inconclusive, suggesting the issue was more fundamental.

## Roadblocks & Key Discoveries

The debugging process led to several key discoveries about how the evaluator handles interface methods and symbolic arguments:

1.  **The `fn.Body == nil` problem**: My initial attempts to add logic inside the `if fn.Body == nil` block in `applyFunctionImpl` were not being triggered. This check is intended for interface methods which have no body. The fact that it wasn't being triggered for the `io.Writer.Write` call meant that the `*object.Function` being passed to `applyFunctionImpl` incorrectly had a non-`nil` `Body`. This was a major roadblock and a confusing discovery.

2.  **The Symbolic Placeholder Typing Bug**: I diagnosed that when `symgotest` creates a symbolic placeholder for a function argument (like `writer io.Writer`), it was not correctly propagating the type information (`io.Writer`) to the placeholder object itself. The type was only being set on the `*object.Variable` that wrapped the placeholder. This meant that when the placeholder was later used as a receiver, `receiver.TypeInfo()` returned `nil`, preventing any interface-related logic from working correctly. **This is a critical bug.**

3.  **The `*object.Nil` Intrinsic Lookup Bug**: In tests where an explicit `nil` is passed for an interface argument (like in `TestEval_ExternalInterfaceMethodCall`), the `evalSelectorExprForObject` function did not have a code path to check for intrinsics on the `nil` object's static type. It would see the `nil` and create a generic placeholder, bypassing the intrinsic check for `(io.Writer).Write`. **This is a second, distinct bug.**

4.  **The Interface Binding Intrinsic Bug**: My very first attempt to fix the issue was to add a check for intrinsics on the *concrete type* inside the interface binding logic. This logic is still necessary. Without it, even if the binding is found, the evaluator would proceed to execute the concrete method's body, skipping the intrinsic registered for it. **This is the third bug.**

It became clear that `TestInterfaceBinding` was failing due to a combination of these issues. The placeholder was not being typed correctly, and even if it were, the binding logic was missing the intrinsic check.

## Major Refactoring Effort

Based on these discoveries, I have identified three precise fixes that need to be made to `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go`.

## Current Status

The code is in a clean, buildable state. The previous failing patches have been reverted. The fixes identified above have **not** been applied. The tests `TestInterfaceBinding`, `TestEval_ExternalInterfaceMethodCall`, and others are still failing.

## TODO / Next Steps

The next agent must apply the following three targeted fixes to `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go`. It is recommended to apply them one by one and run the tests after each to observe their effects.

1.  **Fix `extendFunctionEnv` to correctly type symbolic placeholders.**
    *   **File**: `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go`
    *   **Logic**: In the `else` block where a `SymbolicPlaceholder` is created for a missing argument, copy the type information from the parameter definition (`paramDef`) to the placeholder.
    *   **Diff**:

2.  **Fix `evalSelectorExprForObject` to check for intrinsics on `nil` interface receivers.**
    *   **File**: `symgo/evaluator/evaluator.go`
    *   **Logic**: In the `switch` statement, add a block to the `case *object.Nil:` to check if the `nil` has interface type info and, if so, look up an intrinsic using that type information.

4.  **Verify Fixes**: After applying these patches, run `go test -v ./symgo/...` and confirm that `TestInterfaceBinding` and `TestEval_ExternalInterfaceMethodCall` now pass.
5.  **Continue with Plan**: Proceed with the remaining failing tests as outlined in the original plan.
