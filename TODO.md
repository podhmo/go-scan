## Implemented

- **Core Scanning Engine**: A robust, AST-based engine for parsing Go code. It supports lazy, on-demand, cross-package type resolution, and correctly handles complex scenarios like recursive types and generic type definitions. It can extract detailed information about all major Go constructs, including structs, functions, interfaces, and constants.
    - **Test Package Handling**: The scanner now correctly handles directories containing both a standard package (`pkg`) and its external test package (`pkg_test`) when the `include-tests` option is enabled, preventing "mismatched package names" errors.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Includes the `deps-walk` command-line tool for visualizing dependency graphs (in DOT or Mermaid format) and a powerful underlying library for programmatic graph traversal, including forward and reverse dependency analysis.
- **Code Generation Framework**:
    - **`convert` Tool**: A feature-rich tool for generating type-safe conversion functions, driven by annotations (`@derivingconvert`), struct tags (`convert:"..."`), and global rules (`// convert:rule`). Supports nested types, custom functions, and comprehensive error collection.
    - **`derivingjson` & `derivingbind`**: Tools for generating JSON marshaling/unmarshaling and request binding logic.
    - **Unified Generator (`deriving-all`)**: An efficient, single-pass generator that combines the functionality of `derivingjson` and `derivingbind`.
- **Developer Experience & Testing**:
    - **`scantest` Library**: A testing harness for creating isolated, in-memory tests for tools built with `go-scan`.
    - **`scantest`: Path to Import Path Conversion**: Added a `scantest.ToImportPath` helper function (a wrapper around `locator.ResolvePkgPath`) to simplify converting file paths to Go import paths in tests.
    - **In-Memory File Overlay**: Allows providing file content in memory, essential for testing and tools that modify code before scanning.
    - **Debuggability**: Provides `--inspect` and `--dry-run` modes for easier debugging and testing of code generators.
    - **Test Refactoring**: Moved `symgo` integration tests from the `symgo/evaluator` directory to the `symgo` directory to better separate package-internal tests from integration tests.
- **Analysis & Documentation**:
    - **`symgo` Implementation Analysis**: Conducted a detailed investigation of the `symgo` evaluator's source code and test suite. Confirmed that the implementation of control flow and state management aligns with its documented design as a symbolic tracer, not a standard interpreter. Produced `docs/analysis-symgo-implementation.md` and `summary-symgo.md` to document the findings.
- **`minigo` Script Engine**: A nearly complete, embeddable script engine that interprets a large subset of Go.
    - **Core Interpreter**: The engine is fully implemented, supporting expressions, variables (`var`, `const`, `iota`), assignments, and all major control flow statements (`if`, `for`, `switch`, `break`, `continue`). It also supports `for...range` over integers (e.g., `for i := range 10`).
    - **Functions and Data Structures**: Supports user-defined functions, rich error reporting with stack traces, and composite types including structs, slices, and maps.
    - **Advanced Language Features**: Includes full support for pointers (`&`, `*`), method definitions on structs, interface definitions and dynamic dispatch, struct embedding, and basic generics. The interpreter's `for` loops now correctly create per-iteration variables, preventing common closure-related bugs, and aligning with modern Go semantics.
    - **Go Interoperability**: Provides a robust bridge to Go, allowing scripts to call Go functions, access Go variables, and unmarshal script results back into Go structs via `Result.As()`. Lazy, on-demand loading of imported Go packages is also supported.
- **Final API for `convert` Tool**: A new IDE-native method for configuring the `convert` tool using a `define` package. This allows for type-safe, statically valid Go code for defining conversion rules, improving the developer experience over the previous annotation-based system.
- **Parallel go-scan**: Implemented concurrent parsing and made the core scanner thread-safe.
- **Automated Minigo Bindings Generation**: Created a tool to automatically generate `minigo` bindings for Go packages, including initial support for several standard library packages. ([docs/plan-minigo-gen-bindings.md](./docs/plan-minigo-gen-bindings.md)) (now integrated as `minigo gen-bindings`)
- **MiniGo REPL**: Added a REPL for interactive script evaluation. ([docs/plan-minigo-repl.md](./docs/plan-minigo-repl.md))
- **Full `encoding/json` Support in `minigo`**: Implemented `json.Marshal` and `json.Unmarshal` with support for field tags and complex nested structs. ([docs/trouble-minigo-encoding-json.md](docs/trouble-minigo-encoding-json.md))
- **Extended Standard Library Support & Compatibility**:
    - Automated the generation of bindings for a wide range of standard library packages.
    - Implemented a test suite to validate generated bindings and conducted a thorough compatibility analysis, documenting key limitations and driving numerous interpreter enhancements. ([docs/trouble-minigo-stdlib-limitations.md](./docs/trouble-minigo-stdlib-limitations.md))
    - Resolved a critical FFI bug that prevented method calls on pointers to in-script FFI struct variables, unblocking stateful packages like `text/scanner`. ([docs/trouble-minigo-go-value-method-call.md](./docs/trouble-minigo-go-value-method-call.md))
    - Implemented support for interpreting the `slices` and `errors` packages from source by adding language features like 3-index slicing, variadic functions, and support for struct literals with scoped variables.
- **`docgen` and Symbolic-Execution-like Engine (`symgo`)**: A symbolic execution engine (`symgo`) and a demonstration tool (`docgen`) that uses it to generate OpenAPI 3.1 specifications from `net/http` server code. The engine can trace function calls, resolve types, and evaluate handler logic to infer routes, methods, parameters, and request/response schemas. The `docgen` tool includes a golden-file test suite and can output in both JSON and YAML. ([docs/plan-symbolic-execution-like.md](./docs/plan-symbolic-execution-like.md))
    - Removed manual stubs for standard library types (`net/http`, `io`, etc.) from the `docgen` example, as `go-scan`'s improved module-aware resolution now handles them automatically.
- **Type-Safe `docgen` Patterns**: Enhanced the `docgen` tool to allow defining analysis patterns using type-safe function and method references (`Fn: mypkg.MyFunc`, `Fn: (*mypkg.MyType)(nil).MyMethod`, `Fn: myInstance.MyMethod`) instead of string keys. This involved creating `GoSourceFunction` and `GoMethodValue` objects in the `minigo` interpreter, and handling `BoundMethod` objects, to preserve the necessary definition context and ensure correct symbol and method resolution from various expression forms. ([docs/plan-docgen-minigo-fn-ref.md](./docs/plan-docgen-minigo-fn-ref.md))
- **Scanner Refactoring**: Refactored the main `goscan.Scanner` to separate responsibilities. Lightweight dependency analysis methods (e.g., `Walk`, `FindImporters`) have been moved to a new `goscan.ModuleWalker` struct, while heavyweight parsing methods remain on `goscan.Scanner`. This clarifies the API and improves separation of concerns.
- **`symgo` Evaluator Enhancements**: The symbolic execution engine's evaluator has been significantly improved, resolving critical bugs that previously blocked call-graph analysis tools. This includes better handling of method entry points, reliable dispatch for both pointer and non-pointer receivers, correct type propagation, robust environment management for nested calls, and fixes for panics related to naked returns and incorrect path resolution for external packages.
    - **Centralized Package & Symbol Resolution**: Refactored the evaluator to use a central package cache (`pkgCache`). This ensures that for any given import path, a single, canonical package object is created and used, fixing a class of bugs related to inconsistent symbol resolution. This resolves failures with unexported constants in cross-package calls, improves handling of aliased imports, and correctly resolves package names that differ from their import paths (e.g., `gopkg.in/yaml.v2`). ([docs/trouble-symgo-identifier-not-found.md](./docs/trouble-symgo-identifier-not-found.md))
    - **Robust Recursion Detection**: Fixed a bug where the symbolic evaluator would enter an infinite loop when analyzing methods on cyclically defined types. The recursion detection logic now uses the source position of the method receiver, making it robust against different object instances of the same recursive type.
- **`symgo`: Cross-Module Source Scanning**: Added an option (`--include-pkg` in `docgen`) to allow the `symgo` engine to treat specified external packages as if they were internal, enabling deep, source-level analysis of their functions.
- **Find Orphan Functions and Methods**: A new tool `examples/find-orphans` that uses the improved `symgo` engine to perform whole-program analysis and identify unused functions and methods. It supports multi-module workspaces and `//go:scan:ignore` annotations. It intelligently detects whether to run in "application mode" (starting from `main.main`) or "library mode" (starting from all exported functions).
    - **[x]** **Specification and Logic Refinement**: The specification for the tool's behavior, particularly for library mode, has been significantly clarified and documented in `examples/find-orphans/spec.md`. The core logic has been updated to match. A bug related to intra-package method analysis has been fixed in `symgo`. The previously suspected upstream bug in `go-scan`'s file filtering was found to be a misunderstanding in the test setup itself; the test was using a filename (`not_a_test.go`) that was correctly being filtered as a test file because its name ends with the `_test.go` suffix. The test has been corrected.
    - **Correct Intra-Package Analysis**: Fixed a bug where unexported methods were incorrectly reported as orphans if they were only called by exported methods within the same package. The analysis now correctly treats exported methods as entry points in library mode.
    - **Result Filtering**: The tool now automatically excludes `main.main` and `init` functions from the list of orphans, as they are fundamental entry points.
    - **Scoped Analysis**: The tool's analysis can now be strictly scoped to a user-defined set of target packages. Orphans from upstream dependencies are no longer reported unless those dependencies are explicitly included in the input patterns. This is controlled by resolving file path patterns (`./...`) and import path patterns (`example.com/...`) into a canonical set of target packages. Directory traversal can be fine-tuned with the `--exclude-dirs` flag (e.g., to ignore `testdata`).
    - **[x]** **Enhanced Library Mode Analysis**: In library mode, the analysis now correctly includes all `init` functions and the `main.main` function (if present) as starting points for the call-graph traversal, ensuring that functions used only by these entry points are not incorrectly reported as orphans.
    - **[x]** **Global Variable Initializer Analysis**: Confirmed that functions called in global `var` initializers are correctly treated as "used" in all analysis modes. Added a regression test and updated `spec.md` to reflect this behavior.
    - **[x]** **Correct Scope Handling**: Fixed a bug where the reporting scope (from positional arguments) was incorrectly coupled with the analysis scope flag (`--primary-analysis-scope`). The tool now correctly distinguishes between the set of packages to scan and the set of packages to report orphans from.
- **`find-orphans`: Robust Path Handling**: The tool now correctly handles relative paths for the `--workspace-root` flag and resolves target path patterns (`./...`) relative to the specified workspace root, not the current working directory. This allows for more intuitive and predictable behavior when running the tool from subdirectories.
- **`symgo`: Embedded Method Resolution**: The symbolic execution engine can now correctly resolve and trace method calls on embedded structs, enabling more accurate call-graph analysis for tools like `find-orphans`.
- **`symgo`: Embedded Field Access**: The engine now also correctly resolves and traces field access on embedded structs.
- **`symgo`: Type Switch Support**: The symbolic execution engine now correctly handles `ast.TypeSwitchStmt` nodes, allowing it to analyze code that uses type switches (`switch v := i.(type)`). It correctly scopes the typed variable (`v`) within each case block.
- **`symgo`: Efficient & Configurable Scanning Policy**: The symbolic execution engine no longer scans packages outside the workspace by default, significantly improving performance and scalability. It now uses a `ScanPolicyFunc` to provide fine-grained, dynamic control over which packages are scanned from source versus being treated as symbolic placeholders. This replaces the older, less flexible `WithExtraPackages` mechanism.
- **`symgo`: Shallow Scanning**: The `symgo` evaluator is now more robust and performant when dealing with types from packages outside the defined scan policy. It can now create symbolic placeholders for unresolved types, allowing analysis to continue without crashing and enabling symbolic tracing of method calls on these types. This significantly improves the accuracy of tools like `find-orphans` when analyzing code with external dependencies. ([docs/plan-symgo-shallow-scan.md](./docs/plan-symgo-shallow-scan.md))
- **`symgo`: Field Access on Symbolic Receivers**: The `symgo` evaluator can now correctly access struct fields on symbolic receivers (e.g., a receiver of a method that is the entry point of analysis). This fixes a bug where field access was incorrectly failing with an "undefined method" error, particularly on structs that use `_ struct{}` to enforce keyed literals.
- **`go-scan`: Declarations-Only Scanning**: Added a `WithDeclarationsOnlyPackages` option to the `goscan.Scanner`. For packages specified with this option, the scanner parses all top-level declarations (types, functions, variables) but explicitly discards function bodies. This allows tools like `docgen` to obtain necessary type information from packages like `net/http` without incurring the cost and complexity of symbolically executing their entire implementation. This provides a significant performance and stability improvement for analyzing code that depends on large standard library packages.
- **`minigo` Interpreter Enhancements**: Comprehensive refinements to the `minigo` script engine including comprehensive API documentation and implementation of `defer` and `recover` statements. ([docs/plan-minigo.md](./docs/plan-minigo.md))
- **`minigo` FFI and Language Compatibility**: Resolved critical FFI and language limitations including type inference for empty slice literals, typed nil handling for slices and interfaces, improving overall stdlib compatibility and type checking accuracy.
- **`symgo` Interpreter Core Completion**: Completed the core symbolic execution engine to handle all major AST node types and language constructs. Key improvements include: proper import path resolution ([docs/trouble-symgo-identifier-not-found.md](./docs/trouble-symgo-identifier-not-found.md)), resilience to undefined identifiers, infinite recursion prevention, enhanced AST node support (generics, channels, function literals, etc.), and comprehensive refactoring of evaluator components (Resolver, accessor, Context handling).
- **`symgo` Architecture Refinements**: Major refactoring to improve analysis scope management and error handling. Introduced explicit analysis scopes with `WithPrimaryAnalysisScope` and `WithSymbolicDependencyScope`, enhanced type information for unresolved types, and improved resolver error handling for better robustness.
- **Advanced Analysis and Tool Enhancements**: Implemented comprehensive enhancements including structured logging with source stack traces, automatic workspace detection with `go.work` support, advanced interface method call analysis, multi-module workspace support with unified analysis, enhanced reporting capabilities (JSON output), and wildcard pattern support for improved package discovery.
- **`symgo`: Bounded Recursion**: The symbolic execution engine now uses a bounded recursion strategy to prevent analysis from hanging on deeply recursive functions. The evaluator now halts analysis of a recursive call path after one level, making its behavior consistent with the existing "unroll-once" strategy for loops and improving overall robustness. ([docs/plan-symgo-shallow-recursive.md](./docs/plan-symgo-shallow-recursive.md))


## To Be Implemented

### Fix `symgo` Embedded Interface Resolution ([docs/cont-embedded-interface-fix.md](./docs/cont-embedded-interface-fix.md))
- [ ] Resolve the final logic error in `parseInterfaceType` to correctly inherit methods from embedded interfaces.

### Fix `symgo` Symbol Collision Bug 
- [x] Complete the fix for the symbol collision bug in the `symgo` evaluator and resolve all test regressions.

### `symgo`: Implement Robust Interface Resolution ([docs/plan-symgo-interface-resolution.md](./docs/plan-symgo-interface-resolution.md))
- [x] The `isImplementer` function in `evaluator.go` now correctly handles Go's method set rules for both value and pointer receivers.
- [x] The `resolver.ResolveFunction` method now correctly populates the receiver when creating function objects for methods. A caching layer was added to the interpreter to ensure object identity for functions, fixing recursion detection issues. `TestInterfaceResolution` and its variants now pass.
- [x] `TestInterfaceBinding` now passes, confirming that manual interface-to-concrete-type bindings are resolved correctly.
- [x] `TestEval_InterfaceMethodCall_AcrossControlFlow` now passes. The evaluator correctly accumulates possible concrete types for an interface variable across different control-flow branches.
- [x] `TestDefaultIntrinsic_InterfaceMethodCall` now passes. The test was validated and no regression was found.
- [x] `TestInterfaceResolution` is now order-independent. The test has been refactored to run its validation logic against all 6 permutations of package discovery order, confirming the `Finalize` mechanism is robust.

### symgo: Fix Cross-Package Unexported Symbol Resolution ([docs/trouble-symgo-nested-scope.md](./docs/trouble-symgo-nested-scope.md))
- [x] Evaluate package-level var declarations in `ensurePackageEnvPopulated` to fix "identifier not found" errors for unexported symbols.
- [x] Fix regressions caused by the lazy-evaluation implementation. The core regressions related to variable evaluation, pointer dispatch, and recursion detection have been resolved.
- [x] Verified that 'formatCode' is no longer reported as an orphan by `find-orphans`.

### `symgo` Engine Improvements ([docs/plan-symgo-refine2.md](./docs/plan-symgo-refine2.md))
- [x] **Fix Regressions**: Addressed `e2e` test failures in `find-orphans` by generalizing the handling of unresolved functions and fixing an infinite recursion bug.
- [x] **Trace calls in `for` loop conditions**: Enhance `evalForStmt` to evaluate the `Cond` expression (without using its result for branching) to trace function calls, similar to how `if` conditions are handled. This would improve call graph completeness.
- [x] **Handle Multi-Return from Unscannable Packages**: The evaluator now correctly handles assignments from multi-return functions from packages outside the scan policy. It infers the number of return values from the left-hand side of the assignment and creates an appropriate number of symbolic placeholders, preventing incorrect warnings. ([docs/trouble-symgo.md](./docs/trouble-symgo.md))
- [x] **Fix Division-by-Zero Panic**: Made the constant integer evaluator robust against division by zero, returning a symbolic placeholder instead of panicking.
- [x] **Handle Additional Integer Operators**: The evaluator now recognizes additional integer operators (`%`, `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`) and returns a symbolic placeholder, preventing crashes when analyzing code that uses them.
- [x] **Fix AST Node Handling**: Added support for `*ast.StarExpr` as an assignment target and handled `*ast.ExprStmt` in type switches, resolving several panics in the `find-orphans` tool.
- [ ] **DX: Add Timeout Flag to `find-orphans`**: Add a `--timeout` flag to the `find-orphans` CLI for easier debugging.
