# Continuation 8: Stabilizing the Test Suite and Uncovering a Deeper Conflict

## Goal

The session started with the goal outlined in `docs/cont-symgo-type-switch-7.md`: to implement the **conditional unwrapping** logic in `evalSelectorExpr` to correctly handle method calls on type-asserted variables. The hypothesis from previous work was that unwrapping `SymbolicPlaceholder.Original` should only occur for assertions to concrete types, not interfaces.

## Roadblocks & Key Discoveries

### Roadblock 1: Broken Test Suite
Before any changes could be tested, an initial run of the `symgo/evaluator` tests revealed that the entire suite was failing. The vast majority of tests failed with errors like `main function not found in package environment`. This indicated a systemic issue with the test harness itself, likely caused by a recent refactoring of the evaluator's environment management that the tests had not been updated to reflect.

### Action 1: Test Suite Repair
A significant portion of the session was dedicated to repairing the test suite. The core issue was that tests were creating a local environment and incorrectly expecting the `eval.Eval` function to populate it. The correct approach is to let `Eval` populate the evaluator's internal, canonical package environment and then retrieve that environment for inspection.

This fix was applied systematically to numerous test files, including:
- `evaluator_typeswitch_test.go`
- `evaluator_if_typeswitch_test.go`
- `evaluator_slice_test.go`
- `evaluator_unary_expr_test.go`
- `evaluator_unary_test.go`
- `evaluator_variadic_test.go`
- `evaluator_label_test.go`
- `evaluator_range_test.go`
- `evaluator_shallow_scan_test.go`
- `integration_test.go`
- `evaluator_test.go`

This effort successfully stabilized the test suite, eliminated the spurious failures, and allowed the true, underlying bugs to be analyzed.

### Action 2: Implementing and Testing the Planned Fix
With a stable test suite, I implemented the two-part fix derived from previous sessions:
1.  **Conditional Unwrapping:** In `evalSelectorExpr`, the logic was added to check if a type-narrowed placeholder was being asserted to an interface. If so, the `SymbolicPlaceholder` itself was used for method resolution; otherwise, `placeholder.Original` was unwrapped.
2.  **Nil Receiver Handling:** The `case *object.Nil` in `evalSelectorExprForObject` was enhanced to perform an intrinsic lookup on the interface type of the typed `nil` value.

### Key Discovery 2: The Deeper Architectural Conflict
Even with the test suite fixed and the planned logic correctly implemented, a key test, `TestEval_InterfaceMethodCall_OnConcreteType`, continued to fail. This revealed a deeper architectural issue that the "conditional unwrapping" plan did not account for.

**The conflict is this:**
1.  **Static Type Dispatch (for Interfaces):** For a call like `s.Write()` where `s` is `var s io.Writer`, the evaluator must see the call in terms of the `io.Writer` interface to satisfy certain analysis goals.
2.  **Dynamic Type Dispatch (for Type Narrowing):** For a call like `v.Len()` after `v, ok := i.(*bytes.Buffer)`, the evaluator must see the call in terms of the concrete `*bytes.Buffer` type.

The current evaluator architecture cannot satisfy both requirements simultaneously. The function `evalIdent` eagerly resolves a variable to its dynamic value (e.g., the `*bytes.Buffer` instance), discarding the static `io.Writer` type information before `evalSelectorExpr` is even called. This makes it impossible for `evalSelectorExpr` to know that the original variable was an interface.

My attempts to work around this by making `evalSelectorExpr` look up the variable's static type from the environment fixed the interface case but broke the type-switch case, as it failed to respect the newly narrowed type of the shadowed variable inside the `case` block.

## Conclusion

This session successfully repaired the `symgo/evaluator` test suite, a critical prerequisite for further development. More importantly, it revealed that the plan to fix interface assertions via "conditional unwrapping" was necessary but insufficient. The root cause is a more fundamental conflict in the evaluator's design regarding static vs. dynamic type resolution.

The decision was made to document this deeper challenge and submit the repaired test suite, as this represents significant progress and clarifies the problem for the next session. A robust solution will require a more careful architectural change, likely centered on how `evalIdent` and `evalSelectorExpr` cooperate to preserve and utilize both static and dynamic type information.
